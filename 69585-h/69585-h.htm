<div><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I<br/> <span class='sub-head'>IN GENERAL</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HERE was a time when France extended to
the Baltic, the Ebro and the Tiber; when
the term “Frenchmen” included Frenchmen,
Spaniards, Italians, Belgians, Dutch, Germans
and even a few stray Danes, Poles and Letts; when
Rome was the second city of France, and Amsterdam
the third; when the Emperor of the French was
also King of Italy and Mediator of Switzerland;
when one of his brothers was King of Spain, another,
King of Westphalia, and one of his generals King of
Naples; when all Germany was ruled by his vassals;
when Poland was a French province in all but name;
when Austria was the French Emperor’s subservient
ally; and when one of his less successful
generals had just been appointed ruler of Sweden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never, since the days of the Roman Empire,
had one man held so much power, and never in all
history has so much power been as rapidly acquired
or as rapidly lost. In ten years Napoleon rose from
the obscurity of a disgraced artillery officer to the
dignity of the most powerful ruler in the world; in
ten more he was a despised fugitive flying for his life
from his enemies.
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult for us nowadays to visualize such a
state of affairs. To the people of that time life must
have appeared like a wild nightmare, as impossibly
logical as a lunatic’s dream. There seems to have
been no doubt anywhere that the frantic hypertrophy
could not last, and yet when the end was clearly at
hand hardly a soul perceived its approach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was only one nation of Europe which
escaped the mesmerism of the man in the grey coat,
and that was the British. It was only in Britain
that they did not speak of him with bated breath as
“the Emperor,” and remained undaunted by his
monstrous power and ruthless energy. To the
English he was not His Imperial and Royal Majesty,
Napoleon, Emperor of the French, King of Italy,
Protector of the Confederation of the Rhine, and
Mediator of the Helvetian Republic. No, the
English thought of him merely as Boney, a fantastic
figment of the imagination of the other peoples of
the world, who were of course a queer lot with
unaccountable fears and superstitions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this Boney, this Corsican Ogre, incredible
though he was, loomed appallingly large upon the
horizon. There were beacons all round the coast in
case he landed; his privateers were the scourge of
shipping; prices were at famine point and business
was parlous on account of his activities; the militia
was embodied and there was a ceaseless drain of
recruits into the army; every village mourned the
loss of a son who had enlisted and whose life had
been thrown away in some harebrained expedition
into ill-defined foreign parts. And yet on the other
hand there were considerations which gave an aspect
of unreality to the whole menace. England was constantly
victorious at sea, and though Nelson might
be mourned the glory of Trafalgar and the Nile cast
the possibility of invasion into insignificance. The
English people were confident that on land as well
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
they would beat the French at every encounter.
Not for nothing were Agincourt and Minden
blazoned on English history, and Alexandria and
Maida supplied whatever confirmation might be
desired. Such disasters as that at Buenos Ayres
were forgotten; confidence ran high. When
Wellington gained a victory by which all Portugal
was cleared of the French at one blow the public
annoyance that even greater results had not been
achieved, that the whole French army had not been
captured, was extreme. There were few English
people who did not think that, should Napoleon by
some freak of fortune land in England, the veterans
of Austerlitz and the almost legendary Imperial
Guard would be routed by the militia and the hasty
levies of the countryside. There was nothing which
could drive the realities of war hard home into the
public mind. If prices were high, then as compensation
colonies fell into our hands, employment was
fairly good, and the business of manufacturing arms
and equipment was simply booming. Besides,
intercourse with the Continent was not entirely cut
off for the smugglers worked busily and successfully,
and French lace and French fashions and
French brandy circulated freely. It was hard for
the average Englishman to realize that the Corsican
Ogre was not merely an ogre, especially as the
fantastic cartoons of the period and the wild legends
which were current were more fitted to grace a
child’s fairy-tale than to depict the most formidable
enemy England had yet encountered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the mainland of Europe the picture was
utterly reversed. The reality of war was only too
obvious. The Emperor was no mere cartoonist’s
figure drawn with disgusting detail. They had seen
him; he had ridden into their capitals on his white
horse in the midst of the army which had shattered
their proud battalions over and over again. His
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
power was terrible and his vengeance was swift. In
half the countries of Europe a chance word might
result in the careless speaker being flung next day
into an unknown dungeon. His armies swarmed
everywhere, and wherever they went they left a trail
of desolation behind them. The peasants were
starved and the landowners were ruined, to pay the
enormous taxes which the indemnities he imposed
demanded. The mass of the people, who had once
hailed the great conqueror because his arrival meant
their delivery from feudalism, now found themselves
crushed under a despotism ten times more exacting.
The Emperor was very real to them. Many of
them now served new rulers who had been imposed
upon them by him, and him alone. Wherever he
appeared he was attended by a train of subject kings
to whom his wish was law. At his word an Italian
might find himself a Frenchman, or an Austrian a
Bavarian. And this was no mere distinction without
a difference. Once upon a time the peasant
classes cared little about the politics of their rulers,
or even about which ruler they served. The fate of
a professional army was a royal, not a national concern.
But now every able-bodied man found himself
in the ranks. Badeners fought Portuguese on
the question as to whether a Frenchman should rule
Spain, and a hundred thousand Germans perished
in the northern snows because the Emperor of the
French wished to exclude English goods from
Russian ports. The imposition was monstrous, and
in consequence the question of nationality became
of supreme importance. If a country made war
upon Napoleon every citizen of that country now
realized that defeat meant the continuance of a
slavery as exasperating as it was degrading. The
fact that their eventual victory left them very little
freer does not enter into this argument. It is
sufficient to say that Napoleon was regarded on the
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
Continent with an interest agonizing in its intensity,
and that this interest was nourished in a much more
substantial fashion than prevailed in England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been maintained and has infected all
nationalities alike. The ability of the French nation
to write telling memoirs is nowhere better displayed
than in the period of the Empire. A large amount
of very fascinating material was produced, by which
the history of the period, which had previously been
grossly distorted, was corrected and balanced.
Details were worked out with an elaboration all too
rare. The events in themselves were so exceedingly
interesting, and the books about them were so well
written, that it can hardly be considered surprising
that more and more attention was turned towards
the Empire. In addition, the fascinating personality
of the Emperor concentrated and specialized the
attention. More important than all, since events of
huge importance turned merely upon his own whims
and predilections, it was necessary to analyse and to
examine the nature of the man who had this vast
responsibility. It has become fashionable to inquire
into every detail of his life, and there has grown up
an enormous literature about him. Most of these
books contain a fair amount of truth, but they
nearly all contain a high proportion of lies.
Napoleon himself was a good liar, but by now he
is much more lied about than lying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That coffee legend, for instance. Nine books on
Napoleon out of ten say (with no more regard for
physiology than for fact) that he was accustomed to
drinking ten, twenty, even thirty cups of coffee a
day. Napoleon drinking coffee is as familiar a figure
to us as Sherlock Holmes injecting morphine, but
both figures are equally apocryphal. The best
authorities, people who really knew, are unanimous
in saying that he never drank more than three cups
a day. De Bausset, who was a Prefect of the
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
Palace, and in charge of such arrangements,
distinctly says he took only two, and goes out of his
way to deny the rumours to the contrary which were
already circulating. This is but one example out of
many; perhaps we shall meet with others later on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is necessary first to sketch Napoleon’s career
in brief, for the sake of later reference. The merest
outline will suffice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon began his military life under the old
régime as an officer in the artillery; despite an
inauspicious start, he attracted attention by his
conduct at the siege of Toulon. Later he was nearly
involved in the fall of Robespierre, but, extricating
himself, he served with credit in the Riviera campaign
of 1794. Next, he earned all the gratitude of
which Barras was capable by crushing the revolt of
the Sections against the Directory in 1795. By
some means (it is certain that Josephine his wife had
something to do with it) he obtained the command
of the army of Italy; in 1796 and 1797 he crushed
the Austrians and Piedmontese, conquered Piedmont
and Lombardy, and made himself a name as
the greatest living general. There followed the
expedition to Egypt, where his successes (extolled
as only he knew how) stood out in sharp contrast to
the failures of the other French armies in Italy and
Germany. Returning at the psychological moment,
he seized the supreme power, and made himself
First Consul. Masséna had already almost saved
France by his victory at Zürich and his defence of
Genoa, and Napoleon continued the work by a
spectacular passage of the Alps and a perilously
narrow victory at Marengo. Moreau settled the
business by the battle of Hohenlinden. During
the interval of peace which followed, Napoleon
strengthened himself in every possible way. He
codified the legal system, built up the Grand Army
which later astonished the world, disposed of Moreau
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
and various other possible rivals, assured the French
people of his political wholeheartedness by shooting
the Duc d’Enghien and by sending republicans
wholesale to Cayenne; and finally grasped as much
as possible of the shadow as well as the substance
of royalty by proclaiming himself Emperor and
receiving the Papal blessing at his coronation. But
already he was at war again with England, and the
following year (1805) Russia and Austria declared
against him. He hurled the Grand Army across
Europe with a sure aim. Mack surrendered at Ulm;
out of seventy thousand men only a few escaped.
At Austerlitz the Russian army was smitten into
fragments. Austria submitted, and Napoleon
triumphantly tore Tyrol and Venetia from her, gave
crowns to his vassal rulers of Bavaria and Würtemberg,
and proclaimed himself overlord of Germany
as Protector of the Confederation of the Rhine.
His brother Louis he made King of Holland; his
brother Joseph King of Naples; his brother-in-law
Murat Grand Duke of Berg. Prussia demurred,
and was crushed almost out of existence at Jena.
Russia, tardily moving to her support, was, after a
hard fight at Eylau, beaten at Friedland (1807).
At Tilsit the Emperors of the French and of Russia
settled the fate of Continental Europe, and Jerome,
the youngest brother of Napoleon, was given a new
kingdom, Westphalia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far, nothing but glory and progress; but from
now on, nothing but false steps and failure. First,
the overrunning of Spain and the proclamation of
Joseph as King of Spain. This brought Napoleon
into contact with the enmity of a people instead of
that merely of a king. It gave England a chance of
effective military intervention, and it shook the
world’s belief in the invulnerability of the Colossus
by the defeats of Vimiero and Baylen. Austria
made another effort for freedom in 1809, to submit
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
tamely, after one victory and two defeats, when the
game was by no means entirely lost. Hence
followed further annexations and maltreatment.
Then came blunder after blunder, while the Empire
sagged through its sheer dead weight. The divorce
of Josephine lost him the sympathy of the fervent
Catholics and of the sentimentalists. The marriage
with Marie Louise lost him the support of the
republicans and of Russia. He quarrelled with his
brother Louis, drove him from the country and
annexed Holland. He tried to direct the Spanish
war from Paris, with bad results. Annexation
followed annexation in his attempt to shut the coasts
to English trade. The Empire was gorged and surfeited,
but Napoleon was inevitably forced to
further action. Having irritated each other past
bearing, he and Alexander of Russia drifted into
war, and the snows of Russia swallowed up what few
fragments of the old Grand Army had been spared
from the Spanish and Danube campaigns. It was
like a blow delivered by a dazed boxer—powerful,
but ill-directed and easily avoided, so that
the striker overbalances by his own momentum.
Napoleon struggled once more to his feet. In 1813
he summoned to the eagles every Frenchman
capable of bearing arms. But one by one his friends
turned against him. Prussia, Austria, Saxony,
Bavaria, each in turn joined the ranks of his enemies.
His victories of Lützen, Bautzen and Dresden were
of no avail. At Leipzig his army was shattered; he
fought on desperately for a few more months, but
at last he had to submit and abdicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A further effort after his escape from Elba
ended with the disaster of Waterloo, and merely led
to the last tragedy of St. Helena.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much for the general. From this we can turn
with relief to the particular; and from the particular,
with perhaps even more relief, to the merely trivial.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span><h1>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE MAN HIMSELF</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>O</span>F course, we all know him. He was rather
short and corpulent, and he wore a cocked
hat, a green coat with red facings, and
white breeches. Sometimes, when the mood took
him, he would appear in trailing robes, with a
wreath of laurel round his forehead. Very appropriate,
admittedly, but—that wreath does appear a
little incongruous, does it not? Then there are
times when we see him on a white horse in the midst
of the battle. One or two dead men are lying near
him in graceful attitudes; one or two others are
engaged in dying still more gracefully. His staff is
round him; in the distance are long lines of infantry
and volumes of cannon-smoke. But everything is
so orderly and respectable that one cannot help
thinking that even in that discreet, dim distance the
dying are as careful about their manner as was
Cæsar at the foot of Pompey’s statue. Verestchagin
and others strike a different note, but they never saw
Napoleon alive. We have portraits and pictures
innumerable, but are we any nearer to the man
himself—to what was inside the green coat and
the cocked hat?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the same when we come to read the mountains
of memoirs which have been written around him.
There are solemn memoirs, there are indiscreet
memoirs. There are abusive memoirs, there are
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
flattering memoirs. There are memoirs, written in
all honesty, during the reading of which one cannot
help feeling that the writer would really like to begin
personal pronouns referring to Him with a capital
letter. And yet, after months—years, perhaps—of
reading, one still feels that one knows nothing of
him. One realizes, naturally, that he was a marvellously
clever man, with a marvellous sense of his own
cleverness. But of the man himself, of his little
intimate desires and feelings, one remains ignorant.
A century of memoir-reading will not do as much
for us as would, say, a week’s sojourn alone with him
on a desert island. What adds point to the argument
is that obviously the writer of the most
intimate memoirs was just as far from him as we are.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact of the matter is that Napoleon in all his
life never had a friend. From his adolescence to his
death there was nobody to whom he could speak
unguardedly. It was not so much that he posed, as
that he had himself well in hand on all occasions.
He could unbend; he could pinch a grognard’s ear
or crack jokes with his Guard; he could write passionate
letters to Josephine or supplicatory ones to
Walewska; but we realize that each of these displays
is merely a flash from some new facet of the gem.
To the design of the whole, to the light which glowed
within secretly, we are perforce blind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His tastes in art, which would be a valuable
indication to his character, are variously rated by
contemporaries. One thing is certain, and that is
that art did not flourish under the Empire. A
heavily censored press acts as a drag upon the wheel
of progress in this, as in all other matters, but one
cannot help thinking that this cessation of development
is due as much to Napoleon’s lack of interest
in the subject. David’s hard classicism and Isabey’s
futilities are the best that the Empire can show
in painting, while in sculpture (save perhaps for
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
Houdon), in poetry, in romance, in criticism, not one
names survives, with the slight exception of Madame
de Staël. There is no French contemporary with
Körner who could bear a moment’s comparison;
there is not even any single achievement, like Rouget
de l’Isle’s of the previous decade, to which France
can point with pride. Napoleon’s own favourite
works in literature make a rather curious list;
tragedy was the only kind of dramatic literature
which he favoured, although tragedy is the weakest
part of the French drama, and in tragedy he ranked
Corneille far above all others; Ossian’s poems,
despite translation into French, had a great attraction
for him, perhaps because the exalted wording appealed
to him in his moments of fantastic planning; Goethe,
the greatest living poet, held no fascination for him;
but Rousseau did. Indeed Rousseau’s influence is
clearly visible in many of Napoleon’s own writings.
Beyond this, there is almost nothing modern which
received the seal of his approval. The classics he
read in translation, and solely for the sake of their
matter. Music was not specially liked by him; he
tolerated it because it roused in him the same
sensations as did Ossian’s verse—it was a drug, a
stimulant to him, but not a staple necessary. In
painting he showed no special taste; the honours he
gave David clearly indicate that he held no theories
of his own on the subject. This list of likes and
dislikes is non-committal; it can tell us little about
Napoleon himself; and we are once more brought to
an abrupt halt in our endeavour to discover what
manner of man he really was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet we can approach the question indirectly.
Napoleon had no friend; there was never a time when
he was taken off his guard. His soldiers loved him—stay!
It was not love, it was adoration. That is
the key to the mystery. It was not the love of one
man for another; it was the worship of a God. But
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
just as no man can be a hero to his own valet, so can
no general be a God to his immediate subordinates.
The rank and file could think of Marengo, of
Austerlitz, of Jena, but what of the Marshals? At
Marengo, France was on the verge of a frightful
disaster. The slightest touch would have turned the
scale, and Napoleon, hemmed in against the Alps,
must have surrendered. What of France then, with
a triumphant army at her frontier and not another
regiment at hand? In the Austerlitz campaign it
was nearly the same. Before Jena, Napoleon fell into
error after error. Not until the next day was he made
aware that only half the Prussian army had fought
against him, and that he had recklessly exposed a
single corps to meet the attack of the other half at
Auerstädt. That Davout fought and won was
Napoleon’s good fortune, not the result of his skill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking back on fifteen years of unbroken
success, the private soldiers might well believe
Napoleon to be a God, but the Marshals were near
enough to him to see the feet of clay. For them
there was neither adoration nor love. He was their
taskmaster, and a jealous one at that, lavish of
reprimand and miserly of praise. He gave them
wealth, titles, kingdoms even, but he never risked
rivalry with himself by giving any one of them what
they most desired—military power. The Peninsular
War dragged on largely because he did not dare to
entrust the supreme command of three hundred
thousand men to a single general. With gold and
glory even misers like Masséna became eventually
satiated, and one by one they dropped away from his
allegiance when the tide turned. It fell to Marmont,
the only one of all the Marshals who owed
everything to the Emperor, to surrender Paris to
the Allies and complete his ruin. Not one of the
twenty-six paladins accompanied their master to Elba
or St. Helena; that was left to the junior officers
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
such as Bertrand, Montholon and Gourgaud, who
had been near enough to him to adore, but too far
off to see faults. Yet even to these, life with their
idol became at times unbearable, and more than one
of them deserted before the end. In men Napoleon
could not inspire the love that endures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards women, it is an unpleasant task to
venture a definite opinion. An aura of tradition has
gradually developed around Josephine’s memory, and
she is frequently looked upon as a woman who
sacrificed herself for her love, and allowed herself to
be divorced to aid her husband. Yet her most indignant
partisan would not deny that she had much
to lose beside her husband. The position of Queen
of Queens; unlimited jewels; an unstinted wardrobe
(and she was passionately fond of clothes); the
prospect of the loss of all this might well have moved
a woman to more tears even than Josephine shed.
And of her affection for her husband one may be
permitted to have suspicions. Her circumstances
before the marriage were at least doubtful, and
afterwards—those nasty rumours about Hippolyte
Charles and others seem to have some foundation in
fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of Marie Louise mere mention is enough. When
we come to discuss her later life and her conduct with
Neipperg we shall find clear proof that she did not
love Napoleon. The other women who came into
his life are pale shades compared even to these two.
With none of them was he in love, and none of them
loved him, or came to share his exile. Madame
Walewska visited him for a few days at Elba, but
that was merely to seek further favours for herself
and her son. After Waterloo she married; all her
predecessors had already done the same. Women
did not love Napoleon. We may picture Napoleon,
then, going through life friendless and quite alone.
Never a moment’s relaxation from the stiffness of his
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
mental attitude of superiority; never the light of
friendship in the eye of man or woman; every single
person in Europe was either his slave or his enemy.
To say the least, his was an isolated position. And
yet, was he unhappy? Bourrienne tells us that in
the early Revolution days Napoleon walked the
streets, gaunt and passionate, with a lustful eye for
rich carriages, ornate houses, and all the outward
emblems of power. The phase ended as soon as
power was his, and he passed easily into the condition
of isolation which endured for the rest of his life.
He was the Man of Destiny, the sole creature of his
kind, and he was happy. His isolation never troubled
him in the least. If ever he referred to it, it was in
terms of satisfaction. He was guilty on more than
one occasion of saying that he was above all law, and
it is well known that he believed in his “star”; he
believed that he was marked out by some inscrutable
higher power (the limitations of whose exact
nature he never defined) to achieve unbounded success
and to wield a permanently unlimited power. It is
difficult to imagine such a condition. The most
ordinary or most modest man has usually an undying
belief that his own ability transcends all others, and
that Providence regards him with a special interest,
but deeper still there is almost invariably a further
feeling (often ignored, but usually obvious at a crisis)
that this simply cannot be so. Even if this further
feeling does not become apparent, a man’s sense of
humour usually comes to his rescue and saves him
from the uttermost absurdity. But Napoleon’s
sense of humour was only feebly developed, and in
many directions was totally wanting. On the other
hand, there were certainly many reasons for his
classification of himself as a different being from
ordinary men. He never turned his hand to anything
without achieving much greater success than
his contemporaries. If a codification of law was
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
required, then Napoleon codified laws, without one
half of the difficulty previously experienced. He
won battles over every general whom the Continent
pitted against him. If a province was to be conquered,
or, conquered, had to be reorganized, then
Napoleon was ready at a moment’s notice to dictate
the methods of procedure—and he was usually proved
to be correct. For twelve years, from 1800 to 1812,
Napoleon did not know what it was to fail in any
matter under his own personal control, while during
that period his successes were unprecedented.
Besides, there were more convenient standards of
comparison. He was able to work at a pace which
wore out all his subordinates, and he was able to
continue working long after they had been compelled
to confess themselves beaten. In his capacity for
mental labour he stood not merely unequalled, but
unapproached. Even physically he was frequently
able to display superiority; his staff over and over
again were unable to endure fatigues which he bore
unmoved. Lastly, he was usually able to bend to
his will anyone with whom he came in contact. The
unruly generals of the Army of Italy in 1796 gave
way to him, when he was little more than a favoured
upstart, with extraordinary mildness. He induced
conscientious men like Lefebvre to agree to the most
unscrupulous actions. Alexander of Russia, smarting
under the defeats of Austerlitz and Friedland,
was won over in the course of a few hours’ interview,
and became Napoleon’s enthusiastic ally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There certainly was a great deal in favour of the
theory that Napoleon was a very remarkable man,
but not even the greatest of men is justified in
believing that he is different from other men in kind
as well as in degree. The fact that Napoleon really
did believe this is highly significant. It hints at
something being wanting in his mental constitution,
something similar to, but even more important than
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
a sense of humour. His shameless duplicity in both
his public and his private concerns points to the same
end. His inability to gain the lasting friendship of
any of those with whom he came in contact is another
link in the chain of argument. His complete
disbelief in the disinterestedness of the motives of any
single human being completes it. Napoleon was one
of the most brilliant thinkers the world has ever seen;
he was the most practical and strenuous in action;
he enjoyed for twenty years more good luck than
anyone has ever deserved; but he had a meanness of
soul unsurpassed in recorded history. As a machine,
he was wellnigh perfect (until he began to wear out);
as a man he was deplorably wanting.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>SOME PALADINS</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>T was a common saying in the Napoleonic army
that every man in the ranks carried a Marshal’s
bâton in his knapsack. This was correct in
theory, but in actual practice it hardly proved true.
Every one of the twenty-six Marshals of the First
Empire had held important commands before the
rank was instituted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grouchy, the last Marshal to be created, was
second-in-command of the Bantry Bay expedition
in 1796, when Napoleon was just making his name;
Jourdan had commanded the Army of the North
as far back as 1794.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if the title of Marshal was no more than their
bare due, Napoleon certainly gave his generals
other honours in plenty. One of them, Murat, he
made a King; another, Bernadotte, after receiving
the title of Sovereign Prince of Ponte Corvo, later
became King of Sweden and Norway. Berthier
was Sovereign Prince of Neufchâtel. Three other
Marshals were created Princes of the Empire;
thirteen were created Dukes; six, Counts; and the
only one remaining, Poniatowski, was a Prince of
Poland already.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides titles, wealth without limit was showered
upon them. Suchet received half a million francs
with his bâton; Davout in 1811 enjoyed an income,
all told, of two million francs a year along with the
unofficial dictatorship of Poland and the command
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
of a hundred and fifty thousand men. It was
Napoleon’s habit to bestow upon his generals huge
estates in each country he conquered. Lefebvre
received the domain of Johannisberg, on the Rhine,
which had once belonged to the Emperor of Austria
and later passed to the Metternich family, while Junot
received a castle and estate of the unlucky King of
Prussia. Nearly every man of mark was given five
thousand acres or so in Poland, with the attached
serfs. And Napoleon was the Apostle of the
Revolution!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The one condition attached to the gifts was that
the recipient must spend as much as possible in
the capital. So Parisian shopkeepers grew fat and
praised the Empire; the Paris mob battened on the
crumbs which fell from the tables, and a feverish
gaiety impressed the onlooker. Out in the subject
countries was nothing but a grinding poverty, and in
the countries recently conquered by France the tax-collectors
strove to gather in enough to pay the
indemnities, and even the rats starved because the
Grand Army had passed that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is when we come to examine the careers of the
Marshals that we first meet evidence of one of the
most curious and significant facts of Napoleon’s life.
Everybody to whom Napoleon showed great favour;
everyone who received his confidence; everyone,
in consequence, who had appeared at one time to
be on the direct road to unbounded prosperity,
met with a most tragic and unfortunate end.
Not a few of the worst set-backs which Napoleon
experienced were due to the defects of those whom
he had trusted and aggrandized, and many of his
favourites, apparently too weak morally to endure
the intoxication of success, turned against him
when fortune ceased to smile upon him. Their
deaths were tragic, and their lives were nearly all
dishonourable.
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all the Marshals, Berthier was the foremost
in seniority, in precedence, and in favour. In every
campaign which Napoleon fought, from 1796
to 1814, he held the position of Chief of Staff. The
history of his military career during this period needs
no repetition—it is one with Napoleon’s. Every
conceivable honour was bestowed upon him. He
was given the sovereignty of the principality of
Neufchâtel and Valangin; in 1809 the additional
title of Prince of Wagram; he was appointed a
Senator, a Minister, Vice-Constable of France and
a Grand Dignitary of the Empire; at Napoleon’s
hands he received a bride of royal descent, in the
person of a Princess of Bavaria; in 1810 the supreme
honour was his of representing Napoleon at the preliminary
ceremony of the marriage with Marie
Louise. It seemed that he was one with Napoleon,
his faithful shadow and devoted servant. And yet
when Napoleon abdicated and was sent to Elba,
Berthier threw in his lot with the Bourbons, and
swore allegiance to them. Napoleon’s return and
new accession to power during the Hundred Days,
in consequence placed him in a terrible position.
He was torn between his new allegiance and his old
devotion to Napoleon. The strain proved too
severe. He died at Bamberg, just before Waterloo,
having flung himself from a high window in his
despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second senior of the Marshals was Joachim
Murat. Murat was fortunate in two ways. He was
able to handle large masses of cavalry with decision
on a battlefield, and he married the sister of the
Emperor. There was very little else to recommend
him for distinction, but these two facts were sufficient
to raise him to a throne. Napoleon appointed him
to the command of the cavalry of the Grand Army.
He made him a Prince and Grand Admiral of
France. Next came a sovereignty—the Grand
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
Duchy of Berg and Cleves, and two years later Murat
mounted the throne which Joseph Bonaparte had
just vacated, and became King of the Two Sicilies.
So far, it was a highly satisfactory career for a man
who had begun as the assistant of his father, the inn
and posting-house keeper of La Bastide. Murat
determined to keep his throne, and during the dark
days of 1814 he turned against Napoleon, and
marched at the head of his Neapolitans against the
French. But retribution was swift. He lost his
throne next year in a premature attempt to unite
Italy, and in the end he was shot by the indignant
Neapolitan Bourbons after the miserable failure of
an attempt on his part to recover his crown after the
fashion set by Napoleon in his descent from Elba.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, perhaps, a pardonable digression to consider
here what might have happened had Murat
retained his throne. It is certain that he would
have been as progressive as the Austrians and his own
weak nature would have allowed. It is possible that
the United Italy party would have looked towards
his dynasty instead of to the House of Savoy. The
growing Napoleonic tradition would have aided.
Perhaps to-day we might behold in the south a King
of Italy descended from a Gascon stable-boy, to
balance in the north a King of Sweden descended
from a Gascon lawyer’s clerk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to return to our former theme. So far we
have seen two of Napoleon’s favourites meet with
violent deaths. There are many more instances.
Bessières was a nonentity distinguished by little
except his devotion to the Empire. He attracted
Napoleon’s notice in 1796, and his doglike faithfulness
was a sure recommendation. Bessières became
the Commander of the Guard; later he was created
Duke of Istria and was given immense riches.
Napoleon honoured him with all the friendship of
which he was capable; it seemed not unlikely that a
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
throne would be found for him. But Bessières died
in agony after receiving a mortal wound at Lützen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was Ney, the brave des braves. His
personal courage was almost his only title to fame.
When Napoleon attained supreme power, Ney was
a divisional general of the Army of the Rhine.
Under the Empire he became Marshal, Duke of
Elchingen and Prince of the Moskowa. It was Ney
who made Ulm possible by his victory at Elchingen;
it was he whose attack beat back the Russians at
Friedland; to him is due much of the credit for
Borodino, while his command of the rearguard
during the retreat from Moscow is beyond praise.
And yet he was many times in error. At Jena and
during the Eylau campaign his impetuosity was
almost disastrous. He made several grave mistakes
during Masséna’s campaign in Spain, 1810-1811.
At Bautzen in 1813 he lost a great opportunity, and
he was beaten later at Dennewitz. It was his
vigour and his dauntless courage which recommended
him to Napoleon, who made full use of these
qualities to stimulate the hero-worship of his young
troops. Ney received wealth, high command and a
princely title at the Emperor’s hands. Then he
helped to force the Emperor to abdicate. However,
he was unstable; he betrayed his new king and
went over to Napoleon during the descent from
Elba. Napoleon entrusted him with the task of
staving off the English during the Waterloo
campaign, and he failed lamentably. He lost a
great opportunity at Quatre Bras through having
allowed his columns to lengthen out; he shilly-shallied
all the morning of the 16th of June; he
ruined the campaign by his furious countermand to
d’Erlon in the afternoon; and finally at Waterloo he
wasted the reserve cavalry by his unsupported attacks
on the English squares. And the Bourbons shot
him as soon as possible after the second Restoration.
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Lannes, “the Bayard of the French Army,”
whom Napoleon had called “le braves des braves”
before he gave the title to Ney, met with as
miserable a fate. He had begun life as a dyer’s
apprentice at Lectourne, but enlisted at the opening
of the Revolutionary wars, and was a colonel on
Napoleon’s staff during the first campaign of Italy.
His fearless acceptance of responsibility, and his
magnificent dash and courage while in action were
his great assets, and Napoleon favoured him more
than any of the younger Marshals, except Murat.
It was largely through him that Napoleon found it
possible to employ the strategic weapon which he
invented—the strategic advanced guard. Victories
as widely divided as Marengo and Friedland were
directly due to Lannes, and he was proportionately
rewarded with a Marshalate, a Colonel-generalship, an
enormous fortune and the title of Duke of Montebello.
But he was mortally wounded at Aspern, and
died of gangrene at Vienna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one Marshal whom Napoleon especially
favoured who did not meet with a violent death.
Nevertheless his end was more terrible by far than
was Bessières’ or even Lannes’. This was Marmont,
who in 1796 was a young captain twenty-two years
of age, but who gained Napoleon’s regard to such
good effect that he was Inspector-General of
Artillery at twenty-six, governor of Illyria and
Duke of Ragusa at thirty-four, and Marshal in 1809,
one year later. But he failed in Spain, Wellington
beating him thoroughly at Salamanca. In 1814 he
dealt the finishing blow to the tottering Empire
by his surrender of Paris. He seemed fated to
be unfortunate. Pampered by the Bourbons, he
mishandled the army in Paris during Charles X.’s
attempt at absolute power, and ruined both
the dynasty and himself. He dragged out the
remainder of his life in exile, hated and despised
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
alike by Bonapartists, Legitimists, Orleanists and
Republicans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much for the Marshals Napoleon liked; his
favour certainly appears to have been blighting.
Now for those whom he disliked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Napoleon finally got rid of Moreau, the
man who succeeded in general estimation to the
vacant and undesirable position of unofficial leader
of the unofficial opposition was Jean Baptiste Jules
Bernadotte. This man was one of the most
despicable and successful trimmers in history. In
Moreau’s Army of the Rhine he had attained the
rank of general of division, but he was in no way
a talented leader. Just before Napoleon’s return
from Egypt he had intrigued to attain the supreme
power, but over-reached himself. In Napoleon’s
<span class='it'>coup d’état</span> of the 18th Brumaire he hunted with the
hounds and ran with the hare with remarkable
success, assuring the Directory on the one hand
of his unfaltering support, and yet joining the
group of generals who accompanied Napoleon, but
characteristically not wearing uniform. In addition,
he had a convenient shelter behind a woman’s petticoats,
for with subtle forethought he had married
Joseph Bonaparte’s sister-in-law, Désirée Clary.
Désirée was a jilted sweetheart of Napoleon’s, and
what with her hatred of the great man, Joseph’s
support, and Napoleon’s horror of a scandal in his
family (combined with a sneaking affection for her)
Bernadotte made himself fairly secure all round.
But he still continued to intrigue against Napoleon.
During the Consulate an extraordinary conspiracy
was discovered centring at Rennes, Bernadotte’s
headquarters. Bernadotte himself was undoubtedly
implicated, but he somehow wriggled free from
suspicion. To the Republicans he posed as a
Republican; the Bourbons were convinced that he
was on their side; actually he was working for his
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
own hand, while, thanks to Joseph, he obtained his
Marshalate and the principality of Ponte Corvo from
the Empire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In action, various unsavourily suspicious incidents
occurred in connection with him. In 1806 he took
advantage of an ambiguous order to absent his corps
both from Jena and Auerstädt; the results of his
action might have been far-reaching. Later
Benningsen and the Russian army escaped from
the trap Napoleon had set for them by capturing
vital orders which were on their way to the Prince
of Ponte Corvo. At Wagram his corps was routed
and broken up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when, in 1810, the Swedes were seeking a
Crown Prince for their country, he was the man
they selected. Apparently their choice should have
been agreeable to Napoleon. Was Bernadotte not
the brother-in-law of the King of Spain, a connection
by marriage of the Emperor, Prince of Ponte Corvo
and one of the senior Marshals? Moreover, while
Governor of Hanover, he had had dealings with the
Swedes and had ingratiated himself in their esteem.
Napoleon was furious, but he could do nothing, and
Bernadotte became Crown Prince and virtual autocrat
of Sweden. It only remained for him to win
the favour of Russia by turning against France, so
that, at the Treaty of Abo, Norway as well was
handed over to his tender mercies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later he even angled for the throne of France,
but the French could never forgive the part he had
played in defeating them at Gross Beeren, Dennewitz
and Leipzig; they did not realize that with this
very object in view he had almost betrayed his new
allies, and had hung back and procrastinated in order
to retain his French popularity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But double-dealer, intriguer, traitor that he was,
hated by Napoleon, hated by the French people,
despised by the rest of Europe, he nevertheless
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
held on to his throne, and transmitted it to his
descendants. Nowadays the House of Bernadotte
is not considered too ignoble to wed even with a
branch of the House of Windsor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were other Marshals whom Napoleon
disliked, mainly because of their former association
with Moreau. Macdonald was the son of a supporter
of the Young Pretender, and was a relative of Flora
Macdonald. He failed to pass the examination for
a commission under the old régime, but with the
Revolution came his chance. He distinguished
himself under Dumouriez and Pichegru (who subsequently
turned Royalist), and then under Moreau.
It was an unlucky start for him. The Directory
appointed him to the command of the Army of
Naples, but with this force he was beaten by
Suvaroff in the four days’ battle of the Trebbia.
Subsequently he performed the marvellous feat of
leading an army across the Splugen in midwinter,
but for all that Napoleon employed him as little as
possible, keeping him on half-pay until 1809. However,
Macdonald received his bâton after Wagram;
mainly, it is believed, to throw a stronger light on
Bernadotte’s failure. In 1813 Macdonald, Duke of
Tarentum, was beaten again at the Katzbach, but
by now Napoleon had some idea of his worth and
retained him in command. By a delicious piece of
irony, Macdonald the distrusted was the last Marshal
to leave the Emperor in 1814; he was also one of the
few to adhere to the Bourbons during the Hundred
Days. He enjoyed great honour under the Restoration
and the July Monarchy, and died comfortably
in his bed at the age of seventy-five.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another <span class='it'>bête noire</span> of Napoleon’s was St. Cyr.
He too was one of the “Spartans of the Rhine.”
In consequence Napoleon kept him out of active
service as much as possible. This course of action
was of doubtful utility, for St. Cyr was a man of
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
superior talents. Not until 1812 was he made a
Marshal, but wounds then kept him out of action
until August, 1813, and he was made prisoner by the
Allies in the autumn. The Bourbons, however,
took kindly to him, and he held various high offices
until his death in 1830.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the five favourite Marshals of Napoleon
died miserably, and the three whom he disliked would
be said to have lived happily ever after by any self-respecting
moral story-teller. It is a very curious
fact, and one which finds a parallel elsewhere in
Napoleon’s career, as we shall see in later chapters.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<div><span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ONE WIFE</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>E have already alluded to the intensely
needy period of Napoleon’s life, which
was mainly centred around the year
1795. He knew himself to be a world conqueror;
he despised the shifty intriguers who controlled at
that time both his own destiny and that of France;
he bitterly envied the few insolent survivors of the
old noblesse whom he had met, while his very bread
was precariously earned. It was a maddening
situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then circumstances suddenly took a change for
the better. By a happy accident Barras employed
him to put down the revolt of the sections, and
within a few days Napoleon found himself general
of the army of the interior, and a person of some
consequence. Still, there were bitter drops even in
this first draught of success, for his position depended
solely on the whim of the readily corruptible
Director, who could with a word have sent him
either to a dungeon or to a command-in-chief.
Moreover, the haughty Parisian society regarded
the gaunt, desperately earnest general of twenty-six
with an amusement they made no attempt to
conceal. Parisian society had had nearly two years
by now in which to concentrate, and it was already
crystallizing out. There were old sans-culottes, now
Ambassadors, Ministers or Directors. There were
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
Army contractors in hordes. There were their
wives (either by courtesy or by Republican law)
who were just recovering from the <span class='it'>sans chemise</span>
phase and beginning to ape the old customs of the
<span class='it'>haut noblesse</span>. Finally there were a few of the old
court families along with innumerable pretenders,
ex-valets masquerading as ci-devant marquises;
comtesses (as <span class='it'>précieuses</span> as they could manage) who
had once been kitchenmaids, while every name
hinted at a “de” which had been perforce dropped
during the Terror. And because trifling was for the
moment the fashion, this select band could well
afford to sneer at the ridiculous little Corsican
officer who meant everything he said, and who had
had great difficulty before the Revolution in proving
the three generations of noble descent necessary to
obtain nomination as a military cadet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon in these circumstances acted very
much as he did in a military difficulty. He selected
the most advantageous objective, flung himself upon
it, and followed up his initial success without
hesitation. He broke into the charmed circle of
Directory society by marrying one of its shining
lights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Josephine, vicomtesse de Beauharnais, was a
representative of the farthest outside fringe of
Court society under the old régime. Her marriage
with Beauharnais had been arranged by her aunt,
who was her father-in-law’s mistress. This unfortunate
relationship, combined with poverty and the
obscurity of the family, had barred most of the doors
of pre-Revolutionary society to her, and the Beauharnais
were, in the minds of the Montmorencys and
Rohans, no more worthy of notice than the merest
bourgeois. Of this fact Bonaparte cannot have been
ignorant, no matter what has been said to the
contrary, but it was of no importance to him. He
cared little even for the fact that Beauharnais had
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
been at one time a President of the Constituent
Assembly and Commander-in-Chief of the Army
of the Rhine, before meeting the fate of most of the
Commanders-in-Chief of 1794. All that mattered
to Bonaparte was that Josephine was a member of
the narrow circle of the Directory, that in fact she
and Madame Tallien were the two most important
women therein, and that marriage with her would
gain him admission also. The Directory was fast
becoming a close oligarchy keeping a jealous eye
watching for intruders, and Napoleon had to act at
once. His policy was soon justified, for immediately
after his marriage his position was recognized by the
offer of the longed-for command of the Army of
Italy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were other considerations as well. Josephine
possessed a wonderful charm of manner, and
her taste was irreproachable. The beauty of her
figure was undoubted; that of her face was enhanced
by dexterous art. To Napoleon, starved of the good
things of life, and incredibly lustful after them, she
must have appeared a houri of his Paradise. The
violence of his reaction from a forced self-control may
be judged by the stream of passionate letters which
he sent her every few hours during the opening of
his campaign of Italy. Heaven knows he had difficulties
enough to contend with there, what with
mutinous generals, starving soldiers, and an enemy
twice his strength, but we find him snatching a few
minutes two or three times a day to turn from his
labours and worries in order to contemplate the joys
he had attained, and endeavouring to express them
on paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Josephine’s motives were also mixed. She was
thirty-two years of age, and she was desperately poor.
Her late husband’s property was almost entirely
situated in the West Indies, and it was now held by
the English. Her dreadful experiences under the
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
Terror, when she was imprisoned and within an ace
of being guillotined, had probably aged her and
shaken her nerve. Barras and various bankers had
helped her with funds (perhaps expecting a return,
perhaps not) but such resources would soon come to
an end. In this extremity, appeared Napoleon,
pressing an urgent suit. After all, he was not too
bad a match. He was already general of the army
of the interior, and between them both they ought
to screw some better appointment out of Barras.
He had not a sou to bless himself with beside his
pay, but Republican generals usually found means
to become rich in a short time. If he were killed,
there would be a pension; if he survived, and was
unsuccessful, divorce was easy under Republican
law. She obviously stood to gain much and to lose
little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then it could not be denied that Napoleon
had a way with him. His fierce Southern nature
would sometimes raise a response in her. After all,
she was a Creole, and her Creole blood could hardly
fail to stir at his passionate wooing. Although six
years his senior, disillusioned, experienced, hardened
and shallow though she was, there were times when
his tempestuous advances carried her away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet at other times, when he was absent, and she
had once more caught the infection of cynicism and
trifling from her associates, Napoleon appeared
vaguely absurd to her. “Il m’ennuie,” she would
say, languidly turning the pages of his letters. She
had no desire to leave Paris, where she was enjoying
the prestige of being the wife of a successful general,
to share with him the privations of active service.
Only when Lombardy was in his hands, and a palace
and an almost royal reception were awaiting her, did
she join him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, until she had a position to lose, she
undoubtedly indulged in flirtations. Corsican
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
jealousy may have played a part in the furious rages
to which Napoleon gave rein, but there is no denying
that Josephine was several times indiscreet. In
turn, he suspected Hippolyte Charles, a young
and handsome army contractor, Murat (at that
time his aide-de-camp) and even Junot, his blind
admirer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time that Napoleon was nearing supreme
power, his brief passion for Josephine had burnt
itself out. He himself had already been several
times unfaithful to her, and the only feeling that
still remained was the half-pitying affection a man
bears towards a discarded mistress. On his return
from Egypt he found elaborate preparations made
for him. His family, poisonously jealous of
Josephine, were waiting with circumstantial accounts
of her actions, and they pressed him to obtain a
divorce. Josephine, who had set out to meet him,
in order to get in the first word, had taken the wrong
road and missed him, so that the Bonaparte family
had a clear field. They made the most of it.
Josephine returned to Paris to find her husband
almost determined upon divorce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At one and the same time Napoleon had to
endure the anxieties of the <span class='it'>coup d’état</span>, the urging
of his brothers and sisters and the appeals of his wife
and step-children. It must have been a severe trial,
and in the end he gave way to Josephine. Probably
he realized that it was the wisest thing he could do.
He could ill afford a scandal at this crisis in his career,
and Josephine was a really useful helpmate to him.
He paid off her debts (to the amount of a mere
hundred thousand pounds) and settled down to make
the best of things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lesson was not lost on Josephine. She was
now the first lady of the Continent, and never again
did she risk the loss of that position. Thenceforward
she lived a life of rigid correctness, and instead it was
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
Napoleon who became more and more unfaithful to
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a strange period through which Josephine
now lived. On the one hand she had reached heights
of which she could never have dreamed before; on
the other was the bitter probability that all her
power and position would vanish in a moment when
Napoleon made up his mind to take the plunge.
The other Bonapartes were most bitterly hostile to
her, and lost no opportunity of displaying their
hostility. The only possible method of making her
position permanent was to have a child, and this boon
was denied her. And yet Napoleon found her a
most invaluable ally. Her queenly carriage and
perfect taste in clothes were grateful in a Court
the awkwardness of whose manners was the jest of
Europe. The majority of Frenchmen were honestly
fond of her, and her tactful distribution of the charitable
funds placed at her disposal by Napoleon
enhanced this sentiment. In her meetings with
royalty she was superb; she displayed the arrogance
neither of an upstart nor of an Empress; the Kings
of Würtemberg and of Bavaria grew exceedingly
fond of her. Most important of all, perhaps, was
the help which she gave Napoleon during the Bayonne
Conference. The haughty grandees of Spain, the
harebrained Prince of the Asturias and even the
imbecile King himself showed her the deepest
respect, despite the fact that Napoleon was
endeavouring to coerce them into handing over the
crown to his brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The occasions were rare, however, when Josephine
was allowed to enter into more than the mere ceremonies
of international politics. She was neither
allowed to act nor to advise. At the least hint of
interference on her part Napoleon was up in arms
on the instant. Current rumour credited her with
attempting to save the life of the Duc d’Enghien,
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
and this has frequently been affirmed since, but from
what we know of Napoleon and from what we know
of Josephine we can only conclude that her attempt
was timid and that Napoleon’s refusal was blank and
brief. For Josephine there only remained a purely
decorative function. Other activities were denied to
her (one cannot help thinking that she did not strive
for them with much vigour); she was placidly content
to spend her days in inspections of her wardrobe, in
changing her toilettes half a dozen times daily and
talking scandal with her ladies-in-waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These amusements were not quite as harmless as
might be imagined, for her passion for dress caused
her to run heavily into debt, and every jeweller in
Paris knew that he had only to send her jewellery for
inspection for it to be instantly bought. To pay her
debts she was put to curious expedients. She was
in continual terror lest her husband should discover
them, and she gladly paid enormous blackmail to
her creditors to postpone the day of claim. She even
appealed for assistance to Ministers and other high
officials sooner than tell Napoleon. Naturally the
storms which occurred when the day of reckoning
could no longer be put off were terrible. Napoleon
raged ferociously at every discovery. He paid the
debts, it is true, but he usually arbitrarily reduced
the totals by a quarter or even a half before doing so.
Even then the tradespeople made a large profit, for
they not only made allowance for his action, but they
also took full advantage of Josephine’s uninquiring
nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unstable situation dragged along, to the
surprise of many people, to the consternation of
many others, and to the delight of even more, for
several nerve-racking years. The end had to come
sooner or later, and it came surprisingly late.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE DIVORCE</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>T the close of 1809 Napoleon was at the
height of his power. Every country of
Europe, except England, was his vassal or
his ally, and he was about to send Masséna and a
sufficient force to Spain to ensure that England also
would cease from troubling. The circumstances
which were to lead to the fall of his enormous empire
were already well developed, but they were hardly
obvious to the common eye, which was dazzled by
his brilliance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The one element of weakness apparent was the
lack of an heir to the throne. The equilibrium of
Europe was poised upon the life of one man, and
although many people believed that man to be superhuman,
there was no one who thought him immortal.
Napoleon had been wounded at Ratisbon; perhaps at
his next battle the bullet would be better aimed.
But hit or miss, there were many would-be assassins
in Europe, and knives were being sharpened and
infernal machines prepared in scores of dingy garrets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one could imagine what would happen were
Napoleon to die. The Marshals recalled longingly
the break-up of the Macedonian Empire, and already
in fancy saw themselves kings. The Republicans saw
in his death the downfall of autocracy; the Royalists
hoped for the restoration of Legitimacy. Subject
nations saw themselves free; hostile nations saw themselves
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
enriched. The one thing which obviously
could not happen was the succession of the legal
heir; Joseph in Spain, Louis in Holland and Jerome
in Westphalia were at that very moment showing
how unfit they were to govern anything. The Viceroy
of Italy (Eugène de Beauharnais, Napoleon’s
stepson) was popular and capable, but Napoleon
realized that on account of his lack of Bonaparte
blood he would not be tolerated. There was one
child who might perhaps have been accepted, and that
was Napoleon Charles, son of Louis Bonaparte and
Hortense Beauharnais. Vulgar gossip gave Napoleon
himself the credit for being the father of his step-daughter’s
child, and on this account Napoleon
Charles was considered the likely heir, but he died
of croup. It is possible that calamities without
number would have been prevented had there been
in 1807 an efficient nurse at the sick-bed of a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However that may be, Napoleon had no heir, and
he had given up hope of Josephine presenting him
with one. At the same time, any doubts he had
on his own account were effaced by the birth of a
son to him by Madame Walewska. He dismissed
as impractical a suggested scheme of simulated
pregnancy on Josephine’s part; too many people
would have to be in the secret; if they lived they
would hold as much power as the Emperor himself;
and if (as he was quite capable of doing) he executed
everyone concerned, in Oriental fashion, tongues
would wag harder than ever. Besides, although the
French would apparently put up indefinitely with his
losing a hundred thousand of their young men’s lives
a year, they would not tolerate for one second being
made fools of in the eyes of the whole world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Napoleon might have adopted one of his
own illegitimate sons. Even this wild project he
considered carefully, but he put it aside. The only
course left open was to divorce Josephine and take
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
some more fruitful wife instead, and Napoleon
gradually came to accept this project.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether he was wise or not in this course of
action cannot be decided definitely. Certainly he
was not justified in the event, and he later alluded to
the Austrian marriage as an “abyss covered with
flowers.” What he left out of full consideration
when making his decision was that, while Europe
might suffer his tyranny uncomplainingly if they
believed that the system would end with his death,
they would endeavour to end it at once if there were
a chance of its continuing indefinitely. In a similar
manner the birth of an heir to James II. of England
had precipitated matters a century before. But
whether Napoleon forgot this point, or whether he
believed his Empire more stable than it actually was,
he nevertheless determined on divorce and a new
marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his return from the Wagram campaign of
1809, Josephine found him fixed in his decision.
The connection between their apartments was walled
up, and for weeks the Emperor and the Empress
never met without a third person being present.
It seems strange that the man who did not falter
at Eylau, who sent the Guard to destruction at
Waterloo, should have been daunted by the prospect
of a woman’s tears, but Napoleon undoubtedly put
off the unpleasant interview as long as possible. At
last he nerved himself to the inevitable, and the
dreaded sentence was pronounced. An official of
the palace tells a story of Napoleon’s sudden appearance
among the Imperial ladies-in-waiting carrying
the fainting Empress in his arms. Ten days later,
on the 15th of December, Josephine announced her
acquiescence in the decision to the Imperial council,
and the marriage was annulled by <span class='it'>senatus consultum</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon had endeavoured to procure a more
satisfactory form of divorce from the Pope, but Pius,
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
to his credit, would not assist him. Five years
before, at the coronation, he had refused his blessing
until the Imperial pair had been married by the
Church (the marriage in 1796 was purely a legal
contract), and Napoleon, exasperated but compelled
to yield, had submitted to a ceremony conducted by
the Archbishop of Paris under conditions of the utmost
secrecy. Pius could not in decency give his aid to
break a marriage celebrated at his especial request
only five years before, and in consequence he found
himself a prisoner in French hands, and the last of
the patrimony of St. Peter was annexed to the
French Empire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would puzzle a cleverer man even than
Napoleon to devise a series of actions better calculated
to annoy the Church and its more devout followers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Josephine the pill was gilded in a style
more elaborate even than was customary under
the Empire. She retained her Imperial titles; she
received the Elysée at Paris, Malmaison, and the
palace of Navarre. An income of a hundred and fifty
thousand pounds sterling per annum was settled upon
her. No restraint in reason was set upon her actions;
she was not forced into retirement; and Napoleon
continued to visit her even after his marriage to
Marie Louise. For the last four years of her life
Josephine occupied a position unique in history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Josephine bore her troubles well in public.
However much she may have wept to Napoleon,
however much she may have knelt at his feet imploring
him to have mercy, to the world at large she
showed dry eyes and an immobile expression.
Perhaps her pride came to her help; perhaps, after
all, freedom, the title of Empress, and a monstrous
income, may have reconciled her to her loss of precedence;
it is even conceivable that she preferred the
sympathy of Europe, expressed in no uncertain voice,
to the burdens of royalty.
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Josephine all her life was a <span class='it'>poseuse</span> of minor
mental capacity; what could be more gratifying to
her than a situation where the possibilities of posing
were quite unlimited?</p>

<p class='pindent'>For her, these possibilities were never cut short.
She never had to endure the anticlimax of being the
divorced wife of a fallen Emperor; she died suddenly
just before Napoleon’s first abdication, soon after
receiving visits from all sorts of Emperors and Kings
who were accompanying their armies in the campaign
of 1814.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ANOTHER WIFE</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HUS at the beginning of 1810 Napoleon
found himself once more unmarried, and
free to choose himself a new bride. There
never was a choice so fraught with possibilities of
disaster. It was not so much a matter of making the
most advantageous selection, as of making the least
dangerous. If he married a woman of inferior rank,
all Europe would exultantly proclaim that it was
because no royal family would admit him. If he
married a princess of one of his subject kingdoms,
Bavaria, Würtemberg or Saxony, the others would
become instantly jealous. A Bourbon bride was
obviously out of the question, seeing that he was
keeping all three royal branches out of their patrimonies.
Should he choose a Hohenzollern, then the
countries which held territories which had once been
Prussian would become justifiably uneasy. There
only remained the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs,
and a marriage with either would annoy the other.
The best thing Napoleon could do was to ally himself
with the more powerful, which was undoubtedly the
royal house of Russia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But here Napoleon met with an unexpected
reverse. The Czar Alexander was at once a realist
and an idealist, and he could not decide anything
without months of cogitation. Moreover, the clever
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
advisers round him foresaw that Napoleon’s demands
of their country must increase unbearably, and they
had no intention of tying their ruler’s hands in this
fashion. Torn between his ministers’ advice and the
urging of his old admiration for Napoleon, between
his pride of race and his desire for a powerful alliance,
Alexander temporized and then temporized again.
He explained that all the Grand Duchesses were
members of the Greek Church, and he had qualms
about the necessary change of religion. He tried to
show that they were all already affianced. He said,
literally, that his mother would not allow him to act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the end, Napoleon, fearing a rebuff, and
conscious that delay would weaken his position,
abandoned the project and turned his attention to
Austria. Alexander was naturally annoyed. 1812
may be said to have begun in 1810.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, if a Grand Duchess were unavailable,
an Archduchess would certainly bring Napoleon
compensations. The House of Hapsburg-Lorraine
was the most celebrated in Europe; it had supplied
Holy Roman Emperors since the thirteenth century.
After Napoleon and Alexander, Francis was easily
the most powerful continental ruler, despite his
recent defeats; Aspern and Wagram had just shown
how delicately the balance was poised. But more
than this; the Hapsburgs and the Bourbons had
repeatedly intermarried; if there were anything that
would convince the doubters that Napoleon was a
real, permanent monarch, it would be his marriage
with the niece of Louis XVI, the daughter of His
Imperial, Royal and Apostolic Majesty the Emperor
of Austria, King of Hungary, King of Bohemia,
Duke of Styria, of Carinthia and of Carniola,
erstwhile Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and
titular King of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The achievement would be deficient in some
respects. Tyrol and Dalmatia no longer figured
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
in the Emperor’s resounding list of titles—France
ruled one and Bavaria the other, and Austria might
easily demand restitution as the price of Marie
Louise’s hand. The very name of the new Empress
would remind people of Marie Antoinette, her ill-fated
aunt, and a family alliance between Napoleon
and the autocrat of autocrats might well give the
<span class='it'>coup de grâce</span> to the moribund belief in Napoleon as
the Apostle of the Revolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Be that as it may, Napoleon had already gone
too far to draw back, and early in 1810 he prevailed
on Francis I. to make a formal offer of his daughter’s
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were an oddly contrasting couple. He
was forty, she was eighteen. He was an Italian-Corsican-French
hybrid of unknown ancestry, she
was of the bluest blood in Christendom. He was
the victorious leader of the new idea, she was the
scion of a dying autocracy. Three times had Marie
Louise fled with her family from the wrath of the
French; all her life she had heard the man who was
about to become her husband alluded to as the
embodiment of evil, as the Corsican Ogre, as the Beast
of the Apocalypse. They had never met, and she
had certainly not the least idea as to what kind of
a man he was. All things considered, it was as well
that she had been trained all her life to accept her
parents’ decision on her marriage without demur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her training had been what might have been
expected of the etiquette-ridden, hidebound, conservative,
dogmatic House of Hapsburg. She was
familiar with every language of Europe, because it
could not be foreseen whom she would eventually
marry. Music, drawing, embroidery, all those
accomplishments which permitted of surveillance
and which did not encourage thought were hers.
But she was proudest of the fact that she could
move her ears without moving her face.
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Every possible precaution that she would retain
her valuable innocence had been taken. She had
never been to a theatrical performance. She had
never been allowed to own a male animal of any
species; her principal pets were hen canaries. Her
reading matter was closely scrutinized beforehand,
and every single word which might possibly hint at
difference of sex was cut out with scissors. It seems
probable that she had spoken to no man other than
her father and her uncles. One can hardly be
surprised at reading that her mental power was
small, after being stunted in its growth in this fashion
for eighteen years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon sent as his proxy to Vienna Berthier,
his trusted chief of staff. One can find nowhere
any statement that the Austrians were pleased to
see their princess standing side by side with a
general whose latest acquired title was Prince of
Wagram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps as a sop to the national pride of Austria,
Napoleon sent the bride he had not yet seen presents
which have never been equalled in cost or magnificence.
The trousseau he sent cost a hundred
thousand francs; it included a hundred and fifty
chemises each costing five pounds sterling, and
enormous quantities of all other necessary linen. In
addition he sent another hundred thousand francs’
worth of lace and twelve dozen pairs of stockings at
from one to three pounds sterling a pair. Dressing-table
fittings and similar trifles cost nearly twenty
thousand pounds, but all this expenditure was a mere
trifle compared to the cost of the jewellery which
Marie Louise received. The lowest estimate of this
is placed at ten million francs—four hundred thousand
pounds. Her dress allowance was to be over a
thousand pounds a month.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor stupid Marie Louise might well fancy she
was in Heaven. The daughter of an impoverished
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
emperor, she had never possessed any jewellery other
than a few corals and seed-pearls, and her wardrobe
had been limited both by her niggardly stepmother
and by circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All her life she had been treated as a person of
minor importance, but suddenly she found even her
pride-ridden father regarding her with deference.
Metternich and Schwartzenberg sought her favour.
Her aunts and cousins clustered eagerly round her,
anxious to share in the spoils. It certainly was a
silver lining to the cloud of matrimony with an
unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon on his side was enraptured with the
prospect. His meanness of soul is well displayed by
his snobbish delight. He went to inordinate lengths
in order to secure the approval of the great lady who
had condescended to share his throne. He swept
his palaces clear of anything which might remind his
wife of her predecessor, and refurnished them with
meticulous care. The fittings were standardized as
far as possible, so that she might feel at once at home
wherever she might choose to live; he even arranged
a suite of rooms for her exactly like those she had
lived in at Schönbrunn. Napoleon gave his passion
for organization full rein in matters of this kind,
and without doubt he achieved a splendid success.
“He was a good tenant, this Napoleon,” said
Louis XVIII., inspecting the Tuileries after the
Restoration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not merely her home that Napoleon
adorned for Marie Louise, but even himself. For a
space the green coat was laid aside, and he arrayed
himself in a tunic stiff with embroidery. He tried
to learn to waltz, and failed miserably. In everything
he acted in a manner which amazed even those
who had lived with him for years. No woman was
half so excited over her first ball as was Napoleon over
the prospect of marrying a Hapsburg.
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>He grew more and more excited as Marie Louise
and her train journeyed across Germany and drew
nearer and nearer. From every halting place
despatches reached him in dozens. Marie Louise
wrote to him, Caroline Murat (whom he had sent
to welcome her) wrote to him, Berthier wrote to him,
the ladies-in-waiting wrote to him, even the mayors
of the towns passed through wrote to him. The
officers who brought the letters were eagerly cross-questioned.
The Emperor who, when on the brink
of grand military events, would tell his attendants
only to awaken him for bad news, passed his days
waiting for his unknown bride in a fever of
impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last he could bear it no longer. Napoleon
was at Soissons, where the meeting had been arranged
to take place, but, unable to wait, he rode forward
post haste through pelting rain, with only Murat at
his side. At Courcelles they met the Empress. At
first the coachman was minded to drive past the two
muddy figures who hailed him, but Napoleon made
himself known, and clambered into the Imperial
berline. He would brook not another moment’s
delay. The carriage pelted forward through all the
towns where addresses of welcome were ready, where
droves of damsels all in white were preparing to
greet them, where banquets and fêtes were ready.
They drove past Soissons, where a wonderful pavilion
had been erected, in which the Imperial pair had
expected to meet for the first time during a ceremony
more pompous even than epoch-making Tilsit; they
only stopped when they reached the palace of
Compiegne, where, at nine o’clock at night, a
hurried dinner was prepared by the astonished
servants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the dinner was cut short. Half-way
through Napoleon asked Marie Louise a question;
she blushed, and was unable to answer. It is to be
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
doubted if she even knew what he was talking about.
Napoleon turned to the Austrian envoy. “Her
Majesty is doubtful,” he said. “Is it not true that
we are properly married?” The envoy hesitated.
No one had expected that Napoleon would take the
ceremony by proxy seriously; elaborate arrangements
had been made for a further ceremony in Paris. But
it was useless for the envoy to demur; Napoleon
carried off Marie Louise to his own apartments, and
breakfasted at her bedside next morning. Later his
meanness of soul once more obtruded itself, when he
hinted at his experiences to one of his friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Napoleon was a parvenu among monarchs, he
was at least able to show scoffers that his own royal
ceremonies could put in the shade any similar display
by thousand-year-old dynasties. At Marie Louise’s
coronation four queens bore her train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Characteristically they tried to trip her up with
it. Never before had the world beheld four queens
bearing another woman’s robes, and certainly never
before had it seen anything parallel to the other
exhibition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we come to see who these queens were,
we shall appreciate the peculiar irony of the situation.
First, there was the Queen of Spain, Joseph’s wife,
who was still angry about Napoleon’s jilting of her
sister Désirée, and who furthermore saw as a consequence
of this marriage the probability of the
arrival of a direct heir and the extinction of her
husband’s chances of the succession. Secondly came
Caroline Murat, Queen of Naples, Napoleon’s sister,
violently jealous of Napoleon, of Marie Louise, and
of everyone else. Third came the wife of Jerome
Bonaparte, Catherine, Queen of Westphalia, whom
Napoleon had torn from the arms of her betrothed
to give to his loose-living young brother. The fourth
was Hortense, Queen of Holland, whose mother
Napoleon had just divorced in order to marry the
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
woman whose train Hortense was carrying. Had
Marie Louise been capable of any unusual thought
whatever, she must have felt that she would be
safer entering a powder magazine than going up
the aisle of Nôtre Dame with those four viragoes
at her heels.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<div><span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>SOME COURT DETAILS</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>O</span>NCE bitten, twice shy. Napoleon had had
one wife of whom doubtful stories had
circulated. He would run no risk with the
new one. Marie Louise had been strictly guarded
all her life. Napoleon determined that in that
respect he would substitute scorpions for her father’s
whips. No man was ever to be presented to his wife
without his consent; under no circumstances whatever
was she to be alone with a man at any time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To achieve his object he revived all the court
ceremony of the Soleil Monarque; he added a few
oriental improvements of his own, and to see that his
orders were carried out he surrounded Marie Louise
with women who were the wives and sisters of his
own generals, absolutely dependent on him and
accustomed to military procedure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Austrian ladies who had attended on Marie
Louise before her marriage were sent home, every
single one of them, as soon as she crossed the frontier.
Marie Louise bade good-bye there to the friends of a
lifetime—Napoleon was risking nothing. As Dame
d’Honneur and consequently first lady-in-waiting,
Napoleon appointed the Duchess of Montebello,
widow of the unfortunate Lannes, who had died
fighting at Aspern against Marie Louise’s father and
an army commanded by Marie Louise’s uncle. The
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
other important positions were filled in similar
fashion. Four “red women” were appointed,
whose duty was to be by the Empress’s side night
and day, two on duty and two within call. Had
enough eunuchs been available, Napoleon would
probably have employed them. A seraglio would
have been quite in agreement with his estimation of
woman’s constancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Considering that his court etiquette had to
recover from the citizen phase of the Revolution and
from the solemn, military stiffness of the Consulate,
Napoleon certainly succeeded remarkably well.
Where aides-de-camp sufficed in 1802, equerries were
necessary from 1804 onwards; the <span class='it'>maîtres d’hotel</span>
had to be replaced by chamberlains; the Empress’s
friends had to be appointed ladies-in-waiting. Like
all reactions, this one went too far. The gaiety of
the Bourbon court was extinguished, and the devil-may-care
trifling of the Directory salons perished
equally miserably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon himself was mainly responsible for this.
He was never good company in any sense of the
word. He had a remarkable gift for saying
unpleasant things in an unpleasant manner, and in
his presence the whole company was on tenterhooks,
wondering what was going to happen next. If a
lady had a snub nose, he said so; if a gentleman’s
coat was shabby, he said so with fury, because it was
his pride to be the only shabby person present. If
rumours hinting at a lady’s fall from virtue were in
circulation, he told her so at the top of his voice, and
demanded an explanation. When Napoleon quitted
his court he invariably left half the women in tears
and half the men in a rage. Then Talleyrand, Prince
of Benevento and Grand Chamberlain, would go
limping round from group to group, saying with his
twisted smile, “The Emperor commands you to be
amused.”
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>While Josephine was Empress, this state of
affairs was not so noticeable, for her dexterous tact
soothed the smart caused by Napoleon’s brusqueness,
but under Marie Louise unbearable situations
occurred again and again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be admitted that the various parties at
court made at least as dangerous a mixture as the
constituents of gunpowder. To begin with, the
members of the Imperial family itself were as jealous
of each other as they could possibly be. Pauline,
who was a mere Serene Highness, would grind her
teeth when she had to address her sister Caroline as
“Your Majesty.” Caroline and the other Queens
would rejoice openly because, being Queens, they
were given armchairs when Napoleon’s own mother
had to be content with a stool. And they were one
and all scheming for the succession in the event of
Napoleon’s fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there were still a few Republicans among
the Princes and Dukes. One of the Marshals, compelled
by Napoleon to be present at the solemn Mass
which celebrated the Concordat, salved his conscience
by swearing horribly throughout the ceremony, and,
when asked by the First Consul how he had liked it,
replied that it only needed to complete the picture
the presence of the half million men who had died
to uproot the system. Such men as these thought
little of pushing in front of Serene Highnesses,
or of laughing loudly when Pauline Bonaparte
made the gesture which led to her banishment
from court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there were a few representatives of the
old noblesse, to whom Napoleon, in his wholehearted
snobbery, had offered large inducements to come to
his court. These people regarded the ennobled
barrel-coopers, smugglers and stable-boys with a
mild but galling amusement. On one occasion
Lannes, finding his path to the throne-room blocked
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
by these ci-devants, drew his sword and swore to cut
off the ears of the next person who impeded him.
It was naturally exasperating to the Marshals, who
had risen from the ranks in the course of twenty
campaigns, after receiving wounds in dozens, to find
these nobles given high positions purely on account
of their names. To make matters worse, there were
very lively suspicions that many of them had actually
borne arms against France as <span class='it'>émigrés</span>, in La Vendée,
on the Rhine, or in Italy. Yet even these considerations
were of small account compared to the wrath
of the new nobility when they found that the old still
clung stubbornly together, and refused, apparently,
to admit even the existence of anyone outside the
Faubourg St. Germain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The largest group at court was that of the new
nobility, but its superiority of numbers was discounted
by the violent jealousies of its individual
members. The maxim which guided Napoleon in
his dealings with his subordinates was, apparently,
“Divide et impera.” He set his generals and
ministers by the ears until there was not one of them
who had not some cherished hatred for another.
Davout hated Berthier, Lannes hated Bessières,
Ney hated Masséna, Fouché hated them all, Savary
hated Talleyrand; and the resultant bickerings were
incessant. At court this was merely undignified;
in the field, as was proved twenty times over in the
Peninsular War, it was positively dangerous. It
might be thought that Napoleon, with inexhaustible
funds and domains at his disposal, and unlimited
princely titles in his gift, could have satisfied them
all. But that was where the trouble began.
Napoleon could not give them all they desired, as
otherwise (such was the condition of the Empire)
they would have nothing to fight for. There were
glaring examples of this. When Masséna had been
made a prince, and had accumulated wealth and
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
glory past calculation, he deteriorated hopelessly.
He failed badly in the Busaco campaign of 1810-11,
and sank promptly into an effete degeneracy at the
age of fifty-five. No, Napoleon could not afford to
give his Marshals all they desired, and in consequence
jealousies and friction increased unbearably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the junior officers the difficulties were just
as great. Brutes like Vandamme, aristocrats like
Belliard and Ségur, rakes like Lasalle and fools like
Grouchy, were all mingled together. What was
worse was that generals and diplomats of subject
states necessarily came into contact with them also.
It must have been maddening for the Prussian,
Von Yorck, to hear Vandamme discoursing on the
plunder he had acquired in Silesia in 1806, or for
Schwartzenburg, the Austrian, to hear Lasalle
boasting of his successes among the ladies of Vienna
during the Austerlitz campaign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for a whole year, beginning in 1810,
Napoleon in spite of these difficulties was supremely
happy. There was peace all over the Continent,
and the Continental system seemed at last to be on
the point of success, for England’s finances were
undoubtedly shaken. So short was gold in England
that Wellington in the Peninsula rarely had enough
for his needs, and the Portuguese and Spanish
subsidies were heavily in arrears. Masséna with
a hundred thousand men had plunged into the fog
of guerilla warfare on the Tagus, and everyone was
confidently expecting to hear of the fall of Lisbon
and the expulsion of the English from Portugal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, Napoleon was savouring the delights
of respectable married life. With his nineteen-year-old
wife he indulged in all sorts of innocent pleasures,
riding, hunting, practical joking, theatricals. He so
far forgot himself as to <span class='it'>tutoyer</span> his Imperial bride in
the presence of his whole Court, and the mighty
nobles (who never indulged in such behaviour even
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
in the intimacy of their wives’ boudoirs) were
astonished to hear the Emperor and Empress
exchanging “thees” and “thous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon gave up hours of his precious time to
his wife, waited patiently when she was late for an
appointment (Josephine was never guilty of such an
offence) and generally acted the devoted husband to
the life. For a whole year he was faithful to Marie
Louise, a feat which he never achieved before or
after until St. Helena. And as the months rolled
by and hope changed to certainty his devotion grew
greater still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the birth of the child the most elaborate
preparations were made. Some time before he was
born Mme. de Montesquieu was named Governess
of the Children of France, a healthy Normandy girl
who was in the same condition as the Empress was
secured as prospective wet nurse and kept under
strict surveillance (her own child died when it was
taken from her, but that is not usually recorded),
and all France waited in a hush of expectation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again Napoleon was risking nothing. He
was going to leave no possible foundation for rumours
to the effect that the child was not his, or was not
Marie Louise’s. Napoleon Francis Joseph Charles
was born in the presence of the four doctors, Dubois,
Corvisart, Bourdier and Yvan; of the Duchess of
Montebello, dame d’honneur; of Mme. de Luçay,
dame d’atours; of Mme. de Montesquieu, Governess
of the Children of France; of six premières dames
de chambre; of five women of inferior rank, and
of two filles de garde-robe. Cambacères, Duke of
Parma and Archchancellor of the Empire, was
present in an ante-room, and should have witnessed
the birth even if he did not; Berthier, Prince of
Neufchâtel and Wagram, was in attendance on
Napoleon, and also may have witnessed it, while
immediately after the birth all the other Grand
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
Dignitaries of the Empire and the representatives
of all the friendly countries of Europe were paraded
through the room. Napoleon had ordered Corvisart,
whose nerve was giving way under the strain of the
business, to treat Marie Louise like a bourgeois wife,
but he hardly practised what he preached. The
birth took three days; it certainly seemed a good
omen for this scrap of humanity to keep all these
dozens of people with high-sounding titles waiting
for seventy-two consecutive hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After an anxious ten minutes the young
Napoleon showed signs of life; he had at first
appeared to be dead, and brandy had to be given
him and he had to be discreetly smacked before he
would cry. But he did so at length, and Napoleon
announced to the waiting dignitaries, “It is a King
of Rome.” The guns fired a salute to inform the
expectant crowds; twenty-one guns were to herald
the birth of a daughter; one hundred a son. At the
twenty-second gun a storm of cheers arose. More
than forty years after, a ceremony almost identical
announced the birth of an equally ill-fated son to
another Emperor of the French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the wish of Napoleon’s heart was fulfilled.
For the moment he disregarded all the counter-balancing
disadvantages and revelled in the possession
of an heir. He cared nothing at the time for the
fact that the doctors forbade the Empress to have
the much desired second son to inherit the crown
of Italy; it was nothing to him that Bavaria,
Holland, Würtemberg and Saxony at once became
restless at seeing their period of thraldom indefinitely
prolonged; he hardly cared that Masséna had come
miserably back from Portugal, with a ruined army,
baulked irretrievably by Wellington at Torres
Vedras, so that the “running sore” of the
Peninsular campaign was reopened. He flung
away his last chance of going in person to end the
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
business, merely to remain by the side of the wife
and child of whom he was so proud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But despite his pride, he still left nothing to
chance. Attendance on Marie Louise was maintained
as strictly as before; an unauthorized
presentation to the Empress by the Duchess of
Montebello of some relation of hers called forth a
tornado of wrath from the Emperor. The surveillance
was redoubled when Napoleon left for the
Russian campaign, although he paid her a compliment
which had never been paid to Josephine—he
appointed her Regent. Poor, silly Marie Louise,
three years after being an insignificant princess,
found herself Empress of the French, Queen of
Italy and Regent of half Europe!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her august husband nevertheless saw fit to have
the Empress-Queen-Regent spied upon by a scullion,
who sent him weekly reports, fantastically spelt on
blotched and smeared kitchen paper! Nothing else
is necessary to prove how utterly lacking in decent
instincts was the victor of Austerlitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The action was typical of many. Perhaps
Napoleon was right; everyone knows how readily
autocracy becomes bureaucracy when the autocrat
ceases to supervise his subordinates adequately; but
not even the Second Empire nor Russia at the
beginning of the twentieth century could show so
many spies and counter-spies, police and counter-police
and counter counter-police as did the First
Empire. Secret delation flourished, and the prisons
were full of people who had been arbitrarily cast into
gaol without even a form of trial. Napoleon wished
to know everything that was going on; not the least
stray fragment of tittle-tattle came amiss to him.
Consequently his regular police developed an
organization which spread its tentacles into every
avenue of life. Fouché, Minister of Police, could
boast of having an agent in every drawing-room and
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
kitchen in the Empire. But then Napoleon feared
that Fouché would distort for his own purposes the
reports of the agents when making his own report
to Napoleon. Since Fouché was Fouché such a
thing was not unlikely. So Napoleon had a second
and independent police system making similar
reports to another minister. Yet even when
Fouché was at last got rid of, and packed off as
His Excellency the Governor of Rome (and later
Dalmatia); even when Savary, “the man who
would kill his own father if Napoleon ordered it,”
was in charge of the police affairs the dual police
system was still adhered to. And besides these,
Napoleon had spies of his own, working quite
independently, reporting direct to himself, and he
placed these not only in the two original police
systems, but everywhere where they could keep an
eye on those in high places. His royal brothers
were surrounded with them; they were to be found
in the secretariats of all the ministers; and since
payment was largely by results, and they had to
justify their existence somehow, it is not surprising
that they brought forward trumped-up charges,
suborned perjury, and generally acted as typical
Continental agents-provocateurs. But all this
elaborate system failed to gain the least hint of
the Mallet conspiracy, which came so near to pulling
down the Empire in the autumn of 1812.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were opportunities enough for conspiracy,
goodness knows. Bourbonists and Republicans,
Bonapartists and anarchists, all sought to keep or
to acquire power. The Murats, the Beauharnais,
the various Bonaparte brothers and even Bernadotte,
were all scheming for the succession or the
regency, while intertwining among all this was the
more legitimate scheming of the various European
powers, whose secret agents were equally active
throughout the Empire. There is small room for
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
wonder that after a dozen years of this frantic merry-go-round
the French people accepted the Bourbon
restoration quietly, lest worse befall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet all this does not excuse Napoleon for spying
on his wife; for that the only justification lies in the
event. How many times has Napoleon been rated
for saying that adultery is a matter of opportunity?
But his wife apparently did her best to prove him
right. In 1814 the Empire was falling, and
Napoleon’s abdication was evidently inevitable.
One thing alone raised him to an equality with
hereditary monarchs, and that was the fact that
he had married the daughter of the greatest of them
all. They might exile General Bonaparte, but
would they dare to exile along with him the
Emperor of Austria’s daughter? Besides, in Marie
Louise’s keeping was the young Napoleon. To
allow him to accompany his mother into exile with
his father was simply to court disaster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first the prospect seemed dark for the Allies.
Marie Louise stood firm, refused to be parted either
from her son or from her husband, and generally acted
the devoted wife to the life. In this dilemma the
Allies appealed to the most cunning and cold-hearted
of all their agents—Metternich, who for thirty years
was to hold Europe in the hollow of his hand.
Metternich was the cynic magnificent, without belief
in the constancy of any man or woman born. In
that self-seeking age his opinions were largely
justified. Metternich plunged adroitly into the
affair. He must have known a great deal about the
mentality of feeble-minded women, seeing that one
of his boasts was that he never had fewer than three
mistresses at a time. He selected an agent whom
no one at first sight would have believed to be of any
use, but who turned out to be extremely valuable.
If Neipperg was a knave, he was at least the knave
of trumps. He was an elderly one-eyed diplomat,
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
a count and a general in the Austrian army, with a
good record behind him. He justified Metternich’s
choice remarkably quickly, and while His Imperial,
Royal and Apostolic Majesty looked on and
applauded this prostitution of his daughter, he
wormed his way into Marie Louise’s affections, so
that by the time Napoleon was deposited in Elba,
Marie Louise’s second child (whose engendering
Corvisart had so strictly forbidden) was expected in
a few months’ time, while her first was under lock
and key at Schönbrunn, deprived of all his French
friends and attendants, and started on the unhappy
life which was to end sixteen years later in
consumption, despair and death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Napoleon’s credit be it recorded that never
by word or deed did he hint at this horrible desertion.
All the rest of his life he spoke of Marie Louise with
affection and respect, and had he had his way, Marie
Louise would have been Regent of the French
during the minority of Napoleon II.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marie Louise lived happily for another thirty
years. The Allies rewarded her adultery by giving
her the sovereignty of Parma for life, and there she
lived with Neipperg, whom she married morganatically
as soon as Napoleon was dead. For a long
time she bore him one child a year, and the Emperor
of Austria, with great consideration, made all of
them illegitimate and morganatic alike, princes and
princesses of the Empire. No sooner was Neipperg
dead than she contracted another morganatic
marriage with a person of even lowlier degree.
When she was expelled from her duchy by the
rising of 1831, she was restored by Austrian
bayonets, and she died at length a year before the
far more serious rising of 1848. She never saw her
first-born child after 1815 until he was on his deathbed
in 1832.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unfortunate Louise of Tuscany, who
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
married and then deserted the Crown Prince of
Saxony, tells us that to her, as to all the other
Hapsburg princesses, Marie Louise’s career was
held up as a shining example of the fortune which
attended good girls who did just what the head of
the family, the Emperor, told them. But the
Emperor of Austria, since he had nothing to gain
by it, did not condone the adultery of this particular
Archduchess.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE GREATEST PALADIN</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>N the course of his military career Napoleon
found he needed three different kinds of
subordinate officers. First, he wanted men
of supreme courage and vigour in action, whose
other talents need not be more than mediocre.
These he could keep under his own hand until the
decisive moment arrived, and could then let loose,
confident that they would complete the work which
his strategic achievements had begun. Of this type,
Ney, Augereau and Oudinot were examples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he needed a few generals who combined
initiative and resource along with their tactical
talents. On these he could rely to execute minor
strategical movements, knowing that their tactical
skill would help them to sustain any difficulties into
which they might fall until the perfection of his
strategical arrangements helped them out. The
supreme example of this type was Lannes the
irreplaceable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides these, Napoleon needed one or two men
who could combine all the qualities necessary to a
good general, so that he could entrust to them the
supreme command of the minor theatres of war.
To be a good general, a man must possess strategical
skill, tactical skill and administrative ability, as well
as the personality to ensure that his ideas are carried
out. But to satisfy Napoleon’s jealousy, such a
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
general in the Imperial army had to have another
quality—he had to be a man who would never allow
his thoughts to wander in the direction of obtaining
the throne for himself. If Napoleon could have
found three men with all these qualifications he
could very possibly have maintained his Empire,
since they would have assured to him the safety of
Italy, Spain and Poland. But there was only one
of these Admirable Crichtons available, and that
was Davout. Under Davout Poland and North
Germany were held strongly for the Empire. In
Italy Eugène de Beauharnais, by the aid of powerful
common-sense, high ideals and capable subordinates,
was fairly successful, but in Spain there was nothing
but shame and disaster. Masséna failed badly; so
did Marmont; Joseph Bonaparte and his Major-General,
Jourdan, were worse than useless; Soult
and Suchet made a fair show, but could not rise
superior to the handicap of circumstances. Another
Davout might have saved Spain for the Empire, but
there was only one Davout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Davout is the ideal type of the man who combines
ability with a sense of duty. In many ways
he reminds one of Wellington. He was the scion
of an old noble and military family of Burgundy,
and was born a year later than Napoleon. He
passed through the military college, and received his
commission in 1789, just before the Revolution.
The loss of many officers through emigration gave
him rapid promotion. He was a colonel in 1791
(at the age of twenty-one!) and a brigadier-general
two years later. Already he had attracted attention
by the stern discipline he maintained (discipline
was hardly the most noticeable feature of the
Revolutionary armies) and Napoleon, realizing his
ability, included him in his army after Campo
Formo. He went to Egypt as one of Desaix’
brigadiers, and returned with the same general in
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
1800. After Marengo and the treaty of Luneville,
Napoleon gave him employment suitable to his
talents, and appointed him to the command of the
3rd Corps of the Army of the Ocean. A marshalate
followed in 1804. As commander of the 3rd Corps
Davout began to build up the wonderful reputation
which he later enjoyed. There was no other force
in the Grand Army which could rival the 3rd Corps
for discipline, for marching capacity, for fighting
capacity, and for perfection of equipment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The 3rd Corps was to Napoleon what the
Numidians were to Hannibal, the Tenth Legion
to Cæsar, the archers to Edward III., the Light
Division to Wellington—they were the men who
could be trusted most nearly to achieve the
impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Austerlitz Davout was called upon to sustain
the attack of practically the whole of the Austro-Russian
army, and he and the 3rd Corps clung
doggedly on to the difficult country round the lakes
for hour after hour while Napoleon developed his
attack on the heights of Pratzen. Before Austerlitz
Napoleon had declared that an ordinary victory would
be of no use to him; on the morning of the battle he
called upon his men for a “<span class='it'>coup de tonnerre</span>.” But
for Davout Austerlitz would have been at best an
“ordinary victory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next campaign, that of Jena, was marked by
the failure of Napoleon’s intelligence arrangements
and by confusion in his strategical arrangements.
But it was also marked by the most sweeping success
Napoleon ever gained. He himself with most of
the Grand Army fought and routed half the
Prussian army at Jena. On the same day Davout,
with a single corps, fought and routed the other
half at Auerstädt. Single-handed Davout sustained
the attack of an army of twice his strength; he beat
off Blücher and the furious Prussian squadrons; he
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
counter-attacked without hesitation; he called for
efforts of which few troops could have been capable,
and finally he flung the enemy back in utter disorder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The battle was more than a mere tactical success.
Without Davout’s victory the pursuit after Jena
would never have become historic. In fact Napoleon
refrained from pursuit until he had heard from
Davout. Well he might, indeed. Had Davout
been beaten, Napoleon must have swung aside to
face the victors, who would have been menacing his
flank; Bernadotte’s corps would have been isolated
and in serious peril, and there would have been no
chance of close pursuit of Hohenlohe’s force. This
would have had time to rally; the stern Prussian
discipline would have knitted it once more together;
it might have made a good defence of the line of
the Elbe; the Russians might have arrived in time
to save Berlin; there would perhaps have been no
Friedland, and no Tilsit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stout little bald-pated man who commanded
the 3rd Corps changed the face of Europe at
Auerstädt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Davout brought his corps through blizzards and
across marshes to save the situation at Eylau; it was
his opportune arrival and bold counsel which saved
Napoleon from a grave tactical reverse, with probable
serious consequences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Friedland Napoleon needed, as has already
been said, a man of iron to hold down the north
while he attended to the south. He made the only
possible choice in Davout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would seem curious to us nowadays to hear
that a general had made his fortune while in command;
what a storm of rage would be aroused if
anyone were to suggest that a modern English
general had acquired three or four hundred thousand
pounds while commanding in France! But apparently
under the First Republic and First Empire it
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
was the usual practice for all officers of high rank to
plunder for their own hands, and to make enormous
fortunes out of perquisites. Davout was the only
exception, but Napoleon saw that he did not suffer
on account of his singular disinterestedness, and
heaped wealth upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another peculiar distinction which he gave him
was the title of Duke of Auerstädt. When, about
the beginning of 1808, Napoleon first began to bestow
titles of honour, as distinct from titles of sovereignty,
he acted upon a very definite plan. No one was to
receive a title which did not enhance the glory of
the Emperor. The less famous Marshals received
ducal fiefs in Italy; Macdonald was made Duke of
Tarentum, Mortier Duke of Treviso, Bessières Duke
of Istria. With the title the Marshals received
the fief with some show of sovereignty, but they
were allowed—encouraged, in fact—to sell their
sovereignties to the Empire as soon as received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The more famous Marshals took their titles from
the battles in which they had taken part; Lannes
was made Duke of Montebello, Ney Duke of
Elchingen. Lefebvre, whose reputation for republicanism
Napoleon repeatedly employed to hallmark
his own actions, was created Duke of Dantzic. Soult
strove to obtain for himself the title of Duke of
Austerlitz, but Napoleon put the idea impatiently
aside. He wished to reserve the glory of Austerlitz
entirely for himself, and Soult had to be content
with the title of Duke of Dalmatia, which set him in
the lower class of Marshal. But Napoleon’s jealousy
went further than this. He did not want to give
anyone a title derived from a battle which had not
been fought under his own direction. He forced the
title of Duke of Rivoli upon Masséna, although that
Marshal had to his credit the far greater achievements
of Zürich and Genoa. When it was suggested to
him that it would be a kindly action to make the
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
unhappy, neglected Jourdan Duke of Fleurus, he
replied “Never! I might as well make him King
of France at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this rule Napoleon only made two exceptions.
One was Kellermann, whom he made Duke of Valmy,
but by now Kellermann was too old (he was seventy-three)
to be any danger, while Valmy was a landmark
in French history. The other was Davout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duke of Auerstädt had before him in 1807
a task which would give his sternness and devotion
to duty free play. He had command of at least a
hundred thousand men. For the support of these
he received not a sou from the French Government—everything,
pay, provisions and equipment, had to
be wrung from the wretched countries in which they
were in garrison. From Prussia Davout had to
grind the enormous indemnity which Napoleon had
imposed. In Westphalia he had to see that Jerome
Bonaparte did not make too big a fool of himself.
He had to keep a sharp eye upon the movements
of Austria. Besides all this, he had to govern
the infant Grand Duchy of Warsaw, where he
had simultaneously to assure the Poles that an
independent kingdom of Poland would shortly be
set up, and the Russians and Austrians that an
independent kingdom of Poland would never be
set up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet he succeeded. Throughout northern
central Europe he built himself up a reputation as
the justest brute in Christendom. His army was
well fed and well equipped, but he did his best to
make the burden as light as possible. He saw that
Napoleon’s outrageous demands of Prussia were
complied with, but at the same time he was not
unnecessarily harsh. He sent Polish regiments to
fight in Spain (at Poland’s expense) while he kept
French troops about Warsaw (also at Poland’s
expense), but he managed to persuade the Poles
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
that such a proceeding was just. He carried out
Napoleon’s orders both in the spirit and to the letter,
but after that he made enormous and successful
efforts to minimize the damage done. What would
a second Davout have done in Spain?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in 1809 his proceedings were interrupted.
Austria, undaunted by the conference of Erfurt, and
inspirited by the success of the Spaniards, was on
the move again. Davout had to concentrate his
enormous force on the upper Danube as rapidly as
possible, with a weather eye lifting in case of a
further effort by Prussia, and, once there, he had
to weld his troops once more into divisions and army
corps. From all quarters other troops were being
rushed to the scene of action, and in command of
them all was the hesitating Berthier. Napoleon,
with his hands full with the Spanish muddle, tried
to direct operations from Paris as long as possible.
The natural result was that when the Emperor
arrived at headquarters he found his army divided
and in an apparently hopeless position, with the
skilful and resolute Archduke Charles thrusting
enormous forces between the dislocated wings.
Only a supreme effort could save the situation, but
the situation was saved. Napoleon gathered together
Lannes, Vandamme and Masséna, and hurled them
forward. He called upon Davout to achieve the
impossible, and make a flank march of thirty miles
while in actual contact with superior forces. The
impossible was achieved. Davout brought his men
safely through, to gain along with the other forces
the shattering victory of Eckmühl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Davout’s performance is practically unique in
military history. A year or two later the disastrous
possibilities of a flank march were thoroughly demonstrated
at Salamanca, where Marmont, who prided
himself upon his tactical ability, was utterly routed in
an hour’s fighting by Wellington. Marmont had
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
good troops, and his army was as nearly as possible
equal to Wellington’s, but this did not save him.
Davout’s force was partly composed of new troops,
and of disaffected allies, while his opponents were
nearly twice his strength. Only the most consummate
daring combined with the maximum of vigilance
and skill could have saved Davout, but Davout was
saved. The title of Prince of Eckmühl which
Napoleon bestowed upon him was well deserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next outstanding incident in the campaign
was Napoleon’s first defeat in the open field. He
dared just a little too much in attempting to cross
a broad river in the face of a powerful opponent, with
the result that he was beaten back with frightful loss.
Lannes was mortally wounded; the bridges by which
the army had crossed were broken before Davout’s
turn came to pass over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while the Empire tottered. A prompt
offensive on the part of the Archduke Charles might
have overthrown it, but his army, too, had been hard
hit, and he delayed. Napoleon’s frantic exertions
turned the scale in the end. He claimed Aspern as
a victory, and so skilfully did he make his claim that
for a time he was believed throughout Europe.
Masséna was created Prince of Essling, to conceal
the defeat—in much the same way as the Earl of
Chatham might have been made Duke of Walcheren
in the same year. The army of Italy, under
Eugène, Macdonald and Marmont outmarched their
opponents, and arrived in time to enable the
Emperor to cast the die once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed the Danube a little lower down than
at his previous attempt, turned the Austrian position,
and fought the battle of Wagram on practically equal
terms. It was evenly contested, too. Masséna on
the left was beaten back until the flank was nearly
turned; Bernadotte’s Saxon corps was repulsed in
terrible disorder, and the French reserves were drawn
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
in at an alarming rate. A hundred French guns,
massed in the centre, battered the Austrian line, and
Macdonald led his corps, formed in a gigantic square,
against the gap. But he suffered terribly from the
Austrian artillery, and his men left the ranks in
thousands. In the end, it was Davout on the right
who won the battle for the French, for he turned the
Austrian left and began to roll up their line; the
Austrians fell sullenly back. It was a defeat, not a
disaster, but the Austrians sued for peace immediately
afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Wagram Davout went back to his old post
in the north. Month by month the position grew
more and more difficult, as the topsy-turvy finances
of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw verged nearer to
bankruptcy, and the spirit of nationality grew in
Prussia. But there was never a hint of open rebellion
as long as the bald-headed little man was at the head
of affairs; the Tugendbund might plot in secret;
English agents might stir up trouble at every
opportunity; Blücher might fume and Alexander
might plan, but Davout’s grip was never loosened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, after three years, came the Russian
campaign. Half a million Frenchmen and allies
came thronging forward to the Niemen. A hundred
thousand of these men were under Davout’s command,
and, with Napoleon’s new supply arrangements
breaking down at once, they had to plunder
in order to live. Prussia was left behind secretly
raging, and the doomed army pressed forward over
the barren plains of Lithuania. Everything seemed
to go wrong. The half-trained levies could not
perform the feats of marching which had gained
such marvellous successes at Ulm and after Jena;
the Marshals wrangled among themselves; while
Napoleon, angered by the failure of his plans, dealt
out reprimands right and left until the irritation
became almost unbearable. Jerome Bonaparte,
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
King of Westphalia, was placed under Davout’s command
in consequence of his blundering, but he could
not endure such a state of affairs, threw up his
command, and went back to the softer delights of
his palace at Cassel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Moscow almost in sight, the Russians
delivered battle. Napoleon’s powers were fast
waning, and he paid no heed to Davout’s urgent
pleading that he should be allowed to turn their left.
At Wagram he had exclaimed, “You will see
Davout gain another battle for me,” but at Borodino
he had forgotten this. The battle resolved itself into
a series of horribly costly frontal assaults, and the
victors lost as heavily as their opponents. There
followed five weeks’ useless delay in Moscow;
Napoleon waited for Alexander to plead for terms,
and Alexander refused to consider the matter as long
as a Frenchman remained on Russian soil. No
course was open to the French except retreat, and
retreat they did. There is no need to describe in
detail that exhausted famished army crawling across
the Russian plains; sufficient to say that of the half
million men who had advanced in 1812 hardly thirty
thousand remained to rally on the Oder in 1813.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon left them as soon as hope was lost. He
tore across Europe from Smorgoni to Paris in the
depth of winter with hardly a stop, bent on making
a last effort to save his Empire. Murat was left in
command, but Murat flinched from his task. Three
weeks of command were enough for him, and then
he said he was ill. Ill or not, he travelled from Posen
to Naples in a fortnight, in January weather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somehow Davout and Ney and Eugène de Beauharnais
held the wretched Grand Army together
until Napoleon’s return, and then Davout was sent
off to hold down Northern Germany once more. It
was a task which might have daunted anybody.
Prussia was ablaze with hatred of Napoleon, and
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
Prussian troops were swarming forward to the attack.
The citizens of the Hanseatic towns, ruined by the
Continental system, and bankrupted by Napoleon’s
requisitions, were in a state of sullen rebellion.
Davout’s troops consisted merely of invalids, cripples
and raw levies, while the loyalty of most of them
was to be doubted. Bernadotte, once a Marshal
of France, was leading his Swedes against his old
countrymen. Benningsen with a Russian army
advanced to the attack. But Davout’s grip was upon
Hamburg, and it was a grip which nothing could
break. He held on through the summer of 1813,
while the armistice of Pleissvitz gave hope of relief.
He held on through the autumn, while Austria joined
the ranks of Napoleon’s enemies. The victory of
Dresden was followed by the defeats of the Katzbach,
of Kulm, of Gross Beeren, of Dennewitz, and finally
by the complete disaster of Leipzig, but Davout still
held on to Hamburg. Provisions began to fail, the
populace broke into insurrection; it was known that
the Allies were over the Rhine, that Napoleon was
carrying on a hopeless struggle in France itself.
Marmont, Mortier, Ney, in turn deserted, but
Davout still held on to Hamburg. It was not until
the end of April, when the Bourbons were once more
on the throne of France, and a Bourbon general was
sent to take command, that he relaxed his grip.
Half his army had died during the horrors of the
siege, enormous offers had been made to him for his
submission, the famished inhabitants had implored
him to surrender, but he had allowed nothing to interfere
with his fulfilment of his duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bourbons tried to have him shot for this on
his return, but such a feat was beyond their power.
Thus he was not asked, nor did he ask to take the
oath of allegiance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Napoleon’s return from Elba Davout was the
only Marshal who could join him without staining
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
his honour. Marmont stayed by the Bourbons, for
fear of the consequences of his surrender of Paris;
Macdonald and St. Cyr, Oudinot and Victor, held to
their oaths. Ney flagrantly broke his word to serve
his old Emperor once more; Masséna, as was to be
expected, tried to keep a middle course. Davout
was the one man free from the Bourbon taint, and in
consequence Napoleon had to leave him behind as
Governor of Paris and Minister of War to hold
France quiet during the Waterloo campaign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could it have been otherwise, Waterloo might
well have been a victory for France. We can picture
Davout in command of the left wing in the advance
over the Sambre. In place of Ney’s bungled staff
work and haphazard arrangements, there would have
been a prompt and orderly movement. The columns
would have been kept closed up, instead of straggling
for miles. Davout’s accurate, lengthy reports would
have kept Napoleon clearly informed as to the situation.
A prompt attack on the morning of the 16th
of June at Quatre Bras would have cleared the air
effectively, and d’Erlon, instead of wasting his
strength in marching and counter-marching, could
have been employed to much better advantage at
Ligny. Ney’s position at Quatre Bras was, as a
matter of fact, very like Davout’s at Auerstädt eleven
years before. Davout succeeded at Auerstädt; Ney
failed at Quatre Bras. With Davout in command
of the left wing in the Waterloo campaign, the
history of the world might have been different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Waterloo, when the cavalry was dashing itself
to pieces on the English squares, Napoleon is said to
have cried, “Oh, for one hour of Murat.” Murat
by that time would not have made an atom of difference.
The destiny of France had been decided two
days before at Quatre Bras. One hour of Davout
would have been worth fifty hours of Murat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Waterloo had been lost and won, for a few
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
days it was the Prince of Eckmühl who ruled France.
He pulled the army together, and thereby saved
Napoleon’s life, for he managed to stave off the
Prussian army while Napoleon fled to Rochefort.
But with the return of the Bourbons he sank into
oblivion, and died of pneumonia eight years afterwards
almost unnoticed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the end of the one great officer of
Napoleon’s whose honour had never been sullied,
who had always done his duty, and who had never
failed. His enemies hated him as well as feared him;
his friends feared him as well as trusted him. His
one aim in life was to do his duty; in this aim he
stood almost alone in his age, and in its achievement
he stood quite alone.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>HEN the Marshalate was inaugurated, the
first list afforded many opportunities for
dissatisfaction, both among those included
and those excluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men like Macdonald and St. Cyr, of high reputation
and undoubted talents, found themselves ignored
for political reasons, while giants of the Republican
armies like Masséna found that Napoleon’s family
feeling had given comparatively unknown men like
Murat seniority over them. Masséna’s curt reply to
congratulations on his new appointment was “Yes,
one of fourteen,” and it must indeed have been
galling to him to have Bessières, Moncey and other
nonentities raised to a rank equal to his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For in 1804 Masséna towered in achievement head
and shoulders above all other French soldiers, with
the exception of Napoleon. He was of Italian
extraction (many people said Jewish-Italian, and
hinted that Masséna was a euphonized version of
Manasseh), and he had served fourteen years in
Louis XVI.’s regiment of Italian mercenaries.
Quitting the army, he had plunged into the various
shady employments of the Côte d’Azur. Smuggling
by land and by sea, coast trading, wine-dealing, fruit-selling,
he tried his hand at them all, mainly
successfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But with the revolution came his chance. In two
years he was general of division, and he actually had
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
under his orders at Toulon a certain Napoleon Bonaparte.
For two campaigns Masséna was the life and
soul of the army of the Riviera; Dumerbion, Schérer,
and even Moreau turned to him for counsel. Then
suddenly Barras sent Napoleon as commander-in-chief
in 1796. It is perhaps the greatest tribute to
Napoleon’s personality that as a young man of
twenty-six he was able to compel obedience from a
crowd of generals, many years his senior both in age
and experience. Masséna yielded place to him grudgingly,
but Napoleon found a golden salve for his
injured amour-propre. The campaign of Italy laid
the foundations of the enormous fortune which
Masséna later built up. Every general pillaged and
peculated right and left in those two memorable
years. Napoleon himself was moderate; his fortune
at the end of 1797 only amounted to about two
hundred thousand pounds sterling; Masséna and
Augereau acquired about half a million each.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if they could steal, these men could also fight.
Masséna was the supreme master of tactics, and it
was his division which at that time was given the
most difficult tasks. Battle followed battle, Montenotte,
Mondovi, Lodi, Lonato, Castiglione, Mantua,
Arcola, Rivoli, until at last Austria succumbed; and
by that time, what with gold and glory, the generals
of the army of Italy were Napoleon’s slaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon had served another purpose, too, in
enriching Masséna, for his wealth kept him quiet
while Napoleon was in Egypt. In 1798 the Directory
made a curious blunder. Their army of Rome,
maddened by the peculations of generals and
commissaries, which left the men half starved and in
rags, broke out into mutiny. The man who was sent
to quell them was Masséna! The mutiny naturally
redoubled in intensity, and Masséna was compelled
to give up his command. But at once more congenial
work was given him. Another coalition had
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
declared war upon France, and the Archduke Charles
in Germany and Suvaroff in Italy were gaining success
after success. Masséna was sent to command in
Switzerland, the last buttress of France. Upon him
depended all the hopes of the Republic, and well
he justified the Republic’s confidence. He clung
on desperately, holding back immensely superior
numbers. At last the Aulic Council at Vienna
blundered more badly than usual, and Masséna
grasped at the opportunity, as if it had been a moneybag.
He flung himself upon Korsakoff at Zürich,
and practically destroyed his army. Suvaroff, marching
over the St. Gotthard, only escaped the same fate
by a desperate march along the wildest paths of
Switzerland. France was saved in the same hour as
Napoleon seized the reins of the Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By varied cajolery Napoleon next prevailed upon
Masséna to take command of the army of Italy, and
to hold back the Austrian army while he himself
organized the army of reserve. Napoleon had assured
Masséna that the army of Italy was in good condition,
and that supplies and reinforcements would be sent
him in abundance, but as soon as Masséna arrived
he found how little trust could be placed in the
First Consul’s word. The men were starving and
dispirited, and they were attacked by vastly superior
forces. Somehow Masséna held them together, but
he was forced back into Genoa and closely besieged.
For the troops there was some sort of food, hair-powder
and cocoa mainly, but for the inhabitants
there was—<span class='it'>nothing</span>. For nine weeks Masséna held
out. The troops died in hundreds by the sword,
by disease, by starvation; the inhabitants died in
thousands, and their bodies littered the streets. The
Austrian prisoners who were taken starved to death
in the hulks in the harbour. No wonder that Masséna
said that after the siege he had not one hair left
which was not white on his whole body.
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>At last surrender was necessary. Napoleon had
promised him prompt relief, but the relief never
came. Day by day Masséna had listened for the
thunder of his guns in the near-by Apennines, but
it had never reached his ears. The capitulation was
signed, and the French marched out. But while
Masséna had been clinging to Genoa, Napoleon’s
army was swinging over the Alps. Ten days after
the surrender of Genoa, Marengo gave Italy once
more to the French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Masséna, covered with glory, Napoleon gave
the command of the army of Italy on his own return
to Paris; but the arrangement did not long endure.
Within two months Masséna’s avarice had got the
better of him, and he was removed from his command
and placed upon half-pay on account of his sharp
practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This retirement endured for four years, but in the
Austerlitz campaign Masséna received the command-in-chief
in Italy. If he accomplished little here, at
least he prevented the enemy from achieving any
success, and after Austerlitz and the treaty of Presburg
he was sent to conquer Naples for Joseph
Bonaparte. The campaign was a mere military
promenade, but it ended, as did so many of Masséna’s
commands, in his compulsory resignation on account
of his illicit money-making. On this occasion
Napoleon improved on his previous practice, and
confiscated over a hundred thousand pounds
which Masséna had accumulated in a Livornese
bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again Napoleon summoned Masséna to his
aid in 1807, and at Pultusk and Friedland Masséna
divided the laurels with Lannes and Ney. But it
was the Wagram campaign which brought him the
greatest glory, as it did also to Davout. At
Eckmühl Masséna performed the turning movement
which gained the victory after Davout’s holding
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
attack. At Essling it was Masséna who held the
reeling French line together until darkness brought
relief. At Wagram Masséna, crippled just before
by a fall from his horse, led his corps in a coach drawn
by white horses, the mark for all the enemy’s guns.
Small wonder was it that the end of the campaign
found Masséna both Duke of Rivoli and Prince of
Essling, with a pension of twenty thousand pounds a
year in addition to his pay, his perquisites and his
enormous savings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this was the zenith of Masséna’s fame; it was
to reach its nadir immediately afterwards. Masséna
had lived hard all his life; he had spared himself no
more than he had spared his men, and in addition
he had at intervals indulged in unbridled debauchery.
By 1810 Masséna was an old, worn-out, satiated man,
although he was only fifty-five years of age. All he
wished to do was to retire and live in peace, but
Napoleon was at his wits’ end to find someone who
could be trusted in Spain. Masséna found the command
thrust upon him, and he was forced to accept.
Then followed the blundering campaign of Torres
Vedras. Blunders in the choice of route, blunders in
the attack at Busaco, blunders at Torres Vedras, and
finally, in 1811, the crowning blunder of Fuentes
d’Onoro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These blunders might have been foreseen;
Masséna was old and feeble; he knew nothing of
Spain; he took women with him on the campaign;
his corps commanders were Ney, Junot and Reynier,
all men of hot temper and inferior talent; while
opposed to him was the inflexible Wellington with
his incomparable English infantry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In March, 1811, Masséna was removed from his
command. He crept miserably away, to bury his
shame in the retirement of the Marseilles command.
From that time forward his one aim was to enjoy
his riches in comfort; he made submission to the
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
Bourbons, and then reverted to Napoleon in 1815;
after Waterloo he went back to the Bourbons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though he retained his wealth and his rank,
there was yet further trouble awaiting him. His
treason in 1815 had not been sufficiently extensive in
that age of treason for him to suffer any penalty,
and Louis XVIII., like the most humane Mikado,
determined to make the punishment fit the crime as
far as possible by appointing him one of Ney’s judges.
Masséna must have had a guilty conscience, and the
horror of having to condemn his former colleague for
the same crime as his own weighed heavily on him.
At the same time the atrocious murder of his friend
and fellow Marshal Brune during the White Terror
at Avignon was a further blow. Tortured by
remorse, hated by all parties alike, worn out with a
life lived at high pressure, Masséna died in 1817 at
the age of fifty-nine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Masséna and Davout were the two foremost
officers of Napoleon; the great contrast between
them is due to the fact that one of them was
guided by a strict sense of duty, the other merely
by avarice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was another Marshal who is frequently considered
to be at least the equal of these two, and the
fact that he is so considered is peculiarly illustrative
of his whole career, for Soult was for ever thrusting
himself into the limelight and being elbowed out of
it. Like many of the other Marshals, he rose from
the ranks of the old regular army, and he first attained
high rank by attracting Masséna’s attention. He
was second-in-command to that Marshal during the
siege of Genoa, until he was taken prisoner during a
sortie. He received his Marshalate in 1804, at a
time when he was commanding a corps of the army
at Boulogne, and he continued in command during
the historic march to the Danube. At Austerlitz
he was in command of the centre, and all his life he
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
considered that the battle was won mainly by himself.
He ignored Davout’s splendid defence of the lake
defiles, Murat’s wonderful handling of the cavalry
reserve, Lannes’ management of the left, and Bernadotte’s
assault of the centre; he, and he alone, he
said, was responsible for Austerlitz. He was greatly
disappointed when he was created Duke of Dalmatia
in 1808; he claimed that the only fitting title for
him was Duke of Austerlitz. Napoleon ignored his
pleadings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soult fought at Jena, Eylau and Friedland, 1806-1807,
and was then sent to Spain. To him was
entrusted the pursuit of Sir John Moore to Corunna,
and it cannot be denied that he failed in his mission.
Moore was never seriously engaged throughout the
retreat, and when finally Soult caught him up at
Corunna he was easily beaten back, despite his
superior numbers. But for all that Soult had the
impertinence to claim a victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To him next was assigned the conquest of
Portugal; all he conquered was the northern
extremity; he was two months late in his arrival at
Oporto, and once there he settled down and would
not budge. The reason for this delay soon emerged.
Soult was scheming for the crown of Portugal. But
the plan evaporated promptly when Wellington
unexpectedly passed the Douro, surprised Soult in
his cantonments and bundled him out of Portugal,
compelling him to abandon his guns, his train, his
treasure, his sick—everything, in fact, except what
was on his men’s backs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had Wellington ever suffered a similar reverse he
would probably have received the same treatment as
did Admiral Byng fifty years before, but Napoleon
was lenient and retained Soult in command. The
new task assigned to him was the conquest of
Andalusia, and against the wretched Spanish armies
he achieved some remarkable successes. Seville and
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
Granada fell before him; and he quietly proceeded
to establish himself firmly and make his fortune. He
looted cathedrals and treasuries, and sent the proceeds
home. He ignored the Government of Madrid, and
conducted himself like an independent and absolute
monarch. Cadiz defied him, and all the efforts of
his subordinate, Victor, Duke of Belluno, could not
gain the place for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Masséna, held up at Torres Vedras by Wellington,
with his army starving and disorganized, appealed
to Soult for help. It was grudgingly given—too
late. By the time Soult was ready to move upon the
Tagus Masséna had already fallen back, utterly
ruined. Soult was eventually stirred to action by
Beresford’s siege of Badajoz, but he met with an
unexpected reverse at Albuera (which, characteristically,
he claimed as a victory), and after that he was
content to hold on to Andalusia until at last Wellington’s
victory at Salamanca and capture of Madrid
compelled him to abandon his conquests. So
exasperated was Joseph Bonaparte, King of Spain,
by Soult’s independence that he demanded Soult’s
recall, threatening abdication in the event of refusal.
Napoleon complied, and during the beginning of
1813 Soult commanded the Guard in Germany, but
after Vittoria he was sent back to try and keep the
English out of France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was during this campaign of the Pyrenees that
Soult’s talents were exhibited at their best, but even
here he failed. His manœuvres, concentrations and
determined counter-attacks are models of technical
skill, but the fire, resolution and insight of greater
generals are sadly lacking. He certainly delayed
Wellington, and achieved a fair success considering
the means at his disposal, but he was beaten back
across the Pyrenees, back from Bayonne, from
Orthez, and at last from Toulouse. Napoleon’s
abdication found Soult’s army rapidly disintegrating,
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
and it is certain that the Duke of Dalmatia could
not have continued the struggle much longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1814 and 1815 Soult conducted himself as
might have been expected of a self-seeker. He submitted
to the Bourbons, but went over to Napoleon
as soon as the Emperor was on the throne after the
descent from Elba.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon appointed him chief of staff during the
Waterloo campaign. The choice was unfortunate in
the event, but it is difficult to see what other course
the Emperor could have pursued. Of the five
Marshals fit for service of whom Napoleon could
dispose, Davout had to be left to hold down Paris,
and Suchet had to guard the south. Ney was
obviously useless for staff work, and Grouchy had
neither the brains nor the prestige for a position of
such vital responsibility. So Soult took charge of
the staff, and the staff work was badly done.
Blunders were committed even in the orders given
for the crossing of the Sambre, and subsequently
delay followed delay and error followed error in fatal
sequence. Ney, d’Erlon and Grouchy were in turn
misled by ambiguous orders. The responsibility for
the failure of Waterloo is undoubtedly partly Soult’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally enough, Soult was proscribed after the
second Restoration, but after four years’ exile, he
managed to ingratiate himself with the Bourbons,
and climbed steadily back to power by the aid of
hypocrisy and tuft-hunting. The July revolution
brought him further power, and he was one of the
main props of Louis Philippe’s authority. In fact
the citizen king thought so much of him that he
made Soult Marshal-General of France, thus placing
him on a level with Saxe and Turenne. He lived to
the venerable age of eighty-one, and died at last rich
and honoured above all the other soldiers of France.
His reputation grew steadily after the wars were over,
partly on account of Napier’s liking for him, partly
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
on account of the natural tendency displayed by the
English to over-value a beaten antagonist, and partly
on account of his own deft powers of self-advertisement.
His career is a striking example of the success
of cold, self-contained mediocrity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is only one other Marshal of Napoleon for
whom any claims to greatness have been made, and
that is Suchet, Duke of Albufera. One of the most
interesting points about his career is that he had no
military training whatever before the Revolution.
As a young man of twenty-three years of age he
enlisted; at twenty-five he was a colonel. He made
friends with the young Bonaparte at the siege of
Toulon, and later fought in the Italian campaign of
1796, gaining command of a brigade in 1797.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the rank of general of division he served
Masséna and Joubert, and while Masséna held Genoa
in 1800 Suchet guarded the frontiers of France itself
on the Var.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for eight years longer Suchet had to be content
with the rank of a mere divisional commander,
leading a division of Lannes’ corps at Austerlitz,
Jena and Friedland. At last the wholesale toppling
of reputations in the Spanish war brought him his
chance, and he received command of the army of
Aragon. To say the least, at first his position was
rather awkward. His army was composed of raw
troops, shaken by the horrors of the siege of Saragossa;
the Spaniards were in arms against him on all
sides; he was compelled by the neglect of the Paris
Government to live on the country; while to crown
it all he was expected to obey not only the orders
from Paris but also the frequently contradictory ones
from Joseph at Madrid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We must give Suchet credit for coming through
the ordeal exceedingly well. After an “unfortunate
incident” at Alcaniz, Suchet got his men well in
hand, and, by victories at Maria and Belchite, he
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
cleared Aragon of the enemy and proceeded to subdue
Catalonia. His way was barred in every direction by
fortresses, but, thanks partly to the folly of the
Spaniards and partly to his own resolution and
determination, he conquered the country inch by
inch. Somewhat cynically, in his memoirs, he tells
us that at the storming of Lerida he took care to drive
as many women and children as possible into the
citadel, and then by a vigorous bombardment he so
daunted the garrison that they surrendered. To
what total the casualties among the women and
children amounted before the surrender he does
not say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catalonia in his power, Suchet moved on to the
reduction of Valencia. His previous campaigns
repeated themselves. Battle followed siege, and
siege followed battle, until at last Suchet ruled all
Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia. Soult had already
conquered Andalusia, so that all Spain might, by
straining the truth a little, be said to be in the hands
of the French. For his achievements Suchet received
a Marshal’s bâton, the title of Duke of Albufera and
half a million francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, he was not fated to retain his conquests
long. Wellington’s victory at Vittoria in 1813
brought about Suchet’s evacuation of Valencia, just
as Salamanca had caused Soult to abandon Andalusia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same year an Anglo-Sicilian expedition under
Murray landed in Catalonia, and once more set aflame
the embers of the guerilla warfare. Suchet himself,
in action against unwontedly disciplined enemies,
met with a serious reverse at Castalla, but Murray
was too much of a nincompoop to follow up his
success. In the end Murray once more took ship,
and Suchet still held Catalonia and most of Aragon.
At this time he had a great opportunity to turn
against Wellington, who had his hands full with
Soult’s offensive in the Pyrenees, but he let the
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
chance go. Immediately afterwards Lord William
Bentinck, who had succeeded to Sir John Murray,
kept him busy until the fall of the Empire. Soult’s
and Napoleon’s demands had deprived Suchet of his
best troops, and he did all that could be expected of
him with the few men left to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1814 Suchet submitted to the Bourbons; in
1815 he betrayed them. During the Hundred Days
he was ordered to secure the south-east with a few
thousand men, and though unsuccessful, he accomplished
much. After the Restoration the Bourbons
refused to re-employ him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon is credited with saying that Suchet was
the best of his Marshals after Masséna’s decay, and
also that with two men like Suchet he would have
held Spain against all endeavours. If Napoleon
really did say this (and O’Meara’s testimony is
untrustworthy) Napoleon was wrong. The only time
Suchet encountered English troops he was beaten;
he was just as selfish and self-seeking as the other
Marshals in Spain; he refused help whenever he
could; and his success was due in a great part to the
blunders of his opponents. Every French general
and Marshal (Dupont excepted) succeeded against
Spaniards; it was only against the English that they
failed. Napoleon might just as well have said that
Bessières was his best Marshal, because Bessières beat
the Spaniards at Rio Seco while Masséna failed at
Torres Vedras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The one Marshal of Napoleon’s whose career is
more interesting in its pre-Revolutionary stages than
under Napoleon is Augereau, Duke of Castiglione.
He was a gigantic, swaggering fellow with a nose
rendered brilliant by alcohol, devil-may-care and
reckless, the ideal soldier of fortune. For he was a
soldier of fortune. As a young man in the army of
Louis XVI. he had killed one of his own officers on
parade, and fled from the country with the police at
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
his heels. In exile, he wandered through the East,
joined the Russian army, took part in the storming
of Ismail under Suvaroff, and then deserted. Next
he joined the Prussian army, and served in the
Prussian Guard, but once more he deserted. Desertion
from the Prussian army was a difficult matter,
but Augereau achieved it by banding together all the
malcontents and fighting his way to the frontier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the birth of the Dauphin (later the unhappy
Louis XVII.) an amnesty was proclaimed in France,
and Augereau took advantage of it to rejoin his old
regiment, but once more tired of continuous service
and got himself sent off to Naples as an instructor
to the Neapolitan troops. From Naples he eloped
with a Greek heiress to Lisbon, and in Lisbon he
annoyed the Inquisition, so that he was put in prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But still his luck held. He escaped from the
clutches of the Holy Office, and arrived with his wife
in France just after the execution of Louis XVI.
His varied military experience naturally obtained him
high command in the Republican army; he fought in
La Vendée and in the Pyrenees, and then found
himself a divisional general under Napoleon in 1796.
In this campaign his reckless courage won him fame;
he was one of the heroes of the bridge of Lodi, and
at Castiglione it was his dashing leadership which
gained the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Augereau received the command of the army of
the Rhine after Bonaparte’s departure for Egypt,
but, suspected of intriguing for the supreme power,
he was dismissed from his command, and, two years
later, he saw the prize fall into Napoleon’s hands.
Napoleon bought Augereau’s support with huge gifts
of money and, in 1804, a Marshal’s bâton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the Austerlitz campaign Augereau was
only entrusted with the minor operation of subduing
Tyrol, but he fought well at Jena in 1806. At Eylau
came disaster. His corps, sent forward against the
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
Russians in the teeth of a blinding snowstorm, lost
direction, and was torn to pieces by a furious
cannonade. Three-quarters of his men died; he
himself, already gravely ill, was badly wounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon was furious. Augereau was sent home
in disgrace, and what remained of the 7th Corps was
broken up and distributed round the rest of the army.
This was practically the end of Augereau’s military
life; he held command for a brief space during the
war in Spain, but he failed again at Gerona and was
superseded. By now he was well over fifty years of
age, and dissipation had sapped his vitality. In 1814
and 1815 Augereau received commands of minor
importance, his chief duty being the training of
recruits, but his heart was not in his work. He lived
long enough to betray Napoleon twice and the
Bourbons once, and then died in 1816.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These brief biographies are sufficient to illustrate
what kind of men the Marshals and their master were.
With only a few exceptions they were all traitors,
from Napoleon, plotting against the constitution he
had sworn to uphold, to Ney, deserting his King.
They were greedy, they were unscrupulous, they
were selfish. Many of them were men of second-rate
talent. Two attributes they had in common—extreme
personal bravery and enormous experience
in war. Soult is the only Marshal about whom we
find any hints of cowardice (and there seems to be no
foundation for these hints), while Suchet, Mortier and
Brune were the only ones who had not served in the
pre-Revolutionary army. None of the Marshals was
a heaven-sent genius, and only one, Davout, combined
loyalty and honesty with both military and
administrative ability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is, of course, another side to the picture.
If treachery can be excused at all, then there were
good excuses for the treachery of every one of the
guilty ones; if their talents appear mediocre to us
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
now, it cannot be denied that they were nevertheless
highly successful for a long period; if they were self-seeking,
they were always ready, despite their riches
and titles, to risk their lives in action at the head
of their men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The extravagant praise often meted out collectively
to Napoleon’s subordinates is undeserved, but
somehow one can hardly avoid coming to the conclusion
that a nation might well consider itself fortunate
could it muster a similar array of men in high places.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>N</span>APOLEON was one of a large family,
children of a shiftless father and a
wonderful mother. Much the same
might be said of a large number of other successful
men—Moltke and Lincoln, for instance. But
it is doubtful whether any importance from a
eugenic point of view can be attached to this
circumstance, for although some of the other
Bonapartes showed undoubted talent in various
directions, not one of them has ever displayed
greatness comparable to the Emperor’s. Biologically,
Napoleon might be said to be a “sport,”
a “mutation,” as de Vries would say. Yet even
this theory is open to controversy, for mutations
usually breed true, and none of Napoleon’s children
ever showed, as far as can be ascertained, any really
striking amount of talent. Napoleon may thus be
considered to be an isolated incident in his family
history, one of the many immovable facts which
are so gingerly skirted round by eugenists and other
theorists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What achievements can be ascribed to the
brothers of the man who achieved so much? A
few impracticable suggestions, a few novels (diluted
St. Pierre, most of them), a few lost battles, a few
lost kingdoms; beyond that—nothing. Louis was
the father of Napoleon III., a clever man with many
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
natural disadvantages mingled with his advantages.
Lucien saved one unpleasant situation when
president of the Council of Five Hundred in 1799.
Jerome’s grandson was a fairly eminent lawyer of
the United States. The other Bonapartes were like
their fathers and grandfathers before them, dilettanti,
wobblers, unstable and irresponsible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But useless as were Napoleon’s brothers to him,
he nevertheless bore with them patiently for years.
A clannish clinging together is to be noticed in all
their dealings, both while they were obscure and
while they were powerful. An early Corsican
environment may perhaps account for this, or
perhaps it is to be ascribed to the intense pride in
himself which Napoleon felt, and which perhaps was
extended to all of his own blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon, the second son, and Joseph, the
eldest, were separated from the other brothers and
sisters by a gap of some seven years; the intervening
children had died in infancy. When Charles
Bonaparte, the father, died, therefore, it was upon
these two that the headship of the family and the
attendant responsibility fell. Joseph had already
shown signs of his general uselessness. His mathematics
and education generally had been too weak
for him to have much chance of success in the army;
he flinched from the Church, and therefore returned
to Corsica to farm the few acres the Bonapartes
possessed, and to carry on somehow, Micawber-like,
until something turned up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon, just appointed second-lieutenant of
artillery, took upon himself to keep and educate the
next brother, Louis. Since he had only thirty
pounds a year pay, the struggle must have been
terribly hard. After a year or two came the
temporary success of the Paolists in Corsica, and
as the Bonapartes had taken the French side the
family had to fly to France for safety, leaving all
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
their property behind. Difficulties increased without
number. The French Government, in the
throes of the Terror, had voted monetary support
for the refugees, but in the excitement of the
Toulon rebellion the decree was forgotten, and not
a sou was paid. St. Cyr, the State school for girls,
was closed, and another mouth, that of the eldest
daughter, Elise, had to be fed by the struggling
family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But then everything suddenly changed for the
better. Napoleon, after distinguishing himself at
Toulon, fought his way up to the rank of chef de
brigade. Joseph obtained a commissaryship in the
army of Italy through the aid of a fellow Corsican,
Salicetti. Then also he married Mademoiselle Clary,
daughter of a Marseilles merchant. Her dowry
must have appeared enormous to the famished
Bonapartes—it amounted to no less than six
thousand pounds sterling. None of the Bonapartes
could as yet foresee the day when any one of them
would spend six thousand pounds on their most
trifling whim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A year later Napoleon saved the Directory from
the revolt of the sections, and the family was at last
in comparatively smooth water. With Napoleon in
command of the Army of the Interior, influence
could be brought to bear to help his brothers.
Louis became his aide-de-camp. Lucien received a
commissaryship with the Army of the North, while
immediately afterwards the horizon of possibilities
was widened still further by Napoleon’s appointment
to the command in Italy and his amazing
victories there. Joseph received important diplomatic
appointments at Parma and Rome. Louis
distinguished himself with the army. Lucien at
this time was the black sheep of the family. He
threw up one appointment after another; he
expressed undesirable opinions with undesirable
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
force, and finally he married a completely illiterate
girl of the Midi. However, Napoleon forgave him,
and before setting out for Egypt he enabled him to
secure election to the Council of Five Hundred.
Lucien had always been, even in Corsica, a ranting
rhetorician, and in the Council he would be able to
indulge his bent to his heart’s desire. Jerome, the
youngest brother, was still at school, and he had
to master as best he could his disappointment at
not accompanying Napoleon to Egypt. Eugène
Beauharnais, his schoolfellow, was going; he asked
bitterly why he could not go also, leaving out of
calculation the years of difference in their ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon returned from Egypt to find his
brothers had somewhat improved their positions.
Lucien was president of the Council of Five
Hundred; Joseph’s diplomatic services had enabled
him to enter intimately into the Directory circles,
so that Napoleon was at once able to plunge into
the welter of politics. The <span class='it'>coup d’état</span> of the
19th Brumaire was planned. Joseph acted as intermediary
between Napoleon, Sièyes, Ducos, Bernadotte
(now his brother-in-law), Fouché and Moreau.
Lucien made himself responsible for the Council,
and arranged for the vital meeting to be held at
Versailles. Their united efforts gained for Napoleon
the command of the Army of the Interior. Everything
was in readiness. On the morning of the
19th the Upper House, the Council of Ancients,
readily bowed to the will of the great soldier, but
the Council of Five Hundred were not so willing to
pronounce their own sentence of extinction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murmurs arose and grew louder, and when
Napoleon appeared before them he was greeted
with fierce cries. Half of the Five Hundred were
old <span class='it'>sans-culottes</span>, men who had gambled with their
lives for power under Hébert and Danton, and when
Napoleon, for the only time in his career, flinched
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
from danger, the dreadful cry which had announced
Robespierre’s fall arose. “Hors la loi! Hors la
loi!” shouted the deputies. Napoleon staggered
out of the council hall, apparently ruined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucien Bonaparte leaped into the breach. He
spoke fervently on behalf of his brother, but he was
shouted down by the furious deputies. Somebody
demanded a motion of outlawry against Napoleon;
Lucien refused to put it to the vote. Neither side
would give way, and the passions grew fiercer and
fiercer. Suddenly Lucien tore off the insignia of his
office, and even as he did so the door flew open and
Napoleon’s troops burst in. Leclerc, Napoleon’s
brother-in-law, was at their head. “The Council
is dissolved,” said Leclerc, and the soldiers cleared
the hall with fixed bayonets. Napoleon had utilized
to the full the few minutes Lucien had gained for
him. He had inflamed the soldiers with tales of
treachery and assassination. On the evening of the
same day a rump of the Council met under Lucien’s
presidency and confirmed Napoleon in all the powers
he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first sight this action of Lucien’s appears
invaluable. Nevertheless, on further consideration
one realizes that Napoleon could have succeeded
without it. When Bernadotte was King of Sweden,
he told the French Ambassador, apropos of some news
regarding French parliamentary criticism, that if he
were King of France with two hundred thousand
soldiers at his back he would put his tongue out at
the chamber of deputies. Napoleon at the time
of the <span class='it'>coup d’état</span>, had not merely two hundred
thousand soldiers, but the whole weight of public
opinion at his back. No decree of outlawry by a
discredited Council of Five Hundred could injure
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For all this, Lucien was of great use to Napoleon
during the Consulate. As Tribune, he employed
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
his undoubted parliamentary gifts to foist on the
legislative various unpalatable measures. He skilfully
defended the proposed Legion of Honour to
an acutely suspicious House, and then finally he
effected a judicious weeding of the Senate and Corps
Législatif during the retirements of 1802. For all
these services he was made Grand Officer of the
Legion of Honour, and a Senator; he received a
large official income and a palace (Poppesdorf on the
Moselle), while it seemed as if it would not be long
before he received royal honours. Napoleon proposed
that he should act as French agent in the
Kingdom of Etruria; the Queen was recently
widowed; a marriage would follow naturally, and
Lucien would be proclaimed king. As far as
Napoleon knew, there was no legal bar to such an
arrangement, for Lucien’s illiterate wife had died
some time back, but the proposal forced Lucien to
make an announcement he should have made earlier.
In 1803 he had secretly married a widow, Madame
Jouberthon, who had been his mistress for a year,
and actually had borne him a child the day before the
ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the end of things as far as Lucien was
concerned. Napoleon quarrelled violently with him,
and Lucien left the country. He lived for a time in
Rome, where Pius VII. made him Prince of Canino,
but had to move on at the French occupation. He
tried to reach the United States, but the English
prevented this, as they feared he might have designs
on Spanish America. They could have known little
about the dilatory, hesitating æsthete to imagine he
was capable of any action of importance. Lucien
was brought a prisoner to England, and he promptly
settled down and made himself comfortable at
Ludlow, perfectly contented to enjoy his books, his
scientific dabblings, his pictures, in peace. Once
only did he rouse himself, and that was during the
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
Hundred Days. The old clan feeling apparently
re-awoke, and he was at Napoleon’s side during that
brief period. But as soon as Napoleon had left for
St. Helena, and three months in a Piedmontese
prison had cooled his own blood, he went back to
Rome and continued his placid existence until his
death in 1840. Two or three feeble novels and one
frigid epic stand to his credit—further comment
appears unnecessary; if a man with Lucien’s opportunities
abandons them in favour of a mild life of
artistic enjoyment, he must be either a great man or
a very small man, and Lucien was not a great man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Lucien had at any rate the hardihood to
stand up to his terrible brother about his marriage;
Louis and Jerome gave way in a ridiculous fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louis allowed himself to be persuaded into
marrying Hortense Beauharnais, Napoleon’s step-daughter,
thereby making his sister-in-law Josephine
into his mother-in-law as well. No love was lost
between the newly-married pair, and they drifted
apart after a month or two of married life. A child,
Napoleon Charles, was born at the end of 1802, and
Napoleon was popularly credited with being its
incestuous father. At first he did his utmost to
check these rumours, but later he tried to use them
for his own ends—a scheme nipped in the bud by
the child’s death from croup in 1807. Napoleon
repeatedly tried to reconcile the parents, and on two
occasions he met with success. The product of the
first reconciliation was a child, Napoleon Louis, born
in 1804, who died during the Carbonari insurrection
in Italy in 1831, and the product of the second
reconciliation was another child who later became
Napoleon III.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Louis, for his compliance, honours and
wealth were heaped in profusion. He became a
Prince of the Empire, with a million francs a year;
as Constable of France, and consequently a Grand
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
Imperial Dignitary, he received one-third of a
million francs a year; he was Governor of Paris; a
member of the Council of State; in precedence only
the Emperor and Joseph Bonaparte came before
him. Louis found himself the third person in the
Empire with an annual income of about eighty
thousand pounds sterling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet even this was not all. Austerlitz had laid
Europe at Napoleon’s feet, and he used his power to
the full. The rulers of Bavaria and Würtemberg
became kings; a terse proclamation announced that
the Bourbon house of Naples had “ceased to reign,”
and Masséna with sixty thousand men swept into the
country to establish Joseph Bonaparte on the throne.
Louis was given the kingdom of Holland. Just
before, Napoleon had offered the crown of Italy to
these two brothers in turn, but they had refused it,
partly on account of the utter dependence of Italy
upon France, and partly because one condition of
acceptance was resignation of all claims upon the
throne of France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Holland, when Louis arrived, was in a bad way.
Her people were ground down by remorseless taxation;
the Continental system was ruining them
rapidly; the conscription was exhausting them; and
the outlook generally was hopeless. In fact they
were so sunk in despondency that on one occasion,
when Napoleon called a plebiscite among them to
decide on their Government, only one-sixth of the
voters troubled to vote. With the advent of Louis
they hoped for better things, but Louis was the kind
of man from whom it is better to hope for nothing.
His health was bad, his domestic troubles upset him,
his terrible brother held him completely under his
thumb, and tumbled over like card houses all his
tentative schemes of improvement. Matters in
Holland went from bad to worse. At intervals the
wretched Louis roused himself, and tried to help his
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
subjects, but every time the thunders of Napoleon
daunted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, in 1810, he found the French demanding
military occupation of Holland as the only way to
secure the thorough observance of the Continental
system. A French division was marching on
Amsterdam, and fighting was threatened between
the Dutch troops and the French. Louis dropped
his kingly dignity as if it were red-hot; he abdicated
in favour of his son, Napoleon Louis, and then,
leaving his wife and family behind, he fled across
the frontier and never stopped until he was safe
in Austria. Neither threats nor cajoleries on
Napoleon’s part were able to bring him back to
France and the undignified dignities which were
offered him. He settled down with relief in Styria
with his books and his artistic studies. A novel or
two and some peculiarly unsatisfying memoirs were
all he left behind after his death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hortense, his wife, found means to console
herself. The Comte de Flahault became a frequent
visitor at her house in Paris, and a son was eventually
born to her, who became, under the Second Empire,
the Duc de Morny. Flahault himself was with good
reason believed to be a son of the great Talleyrand,
Prince of Benevento, so that de Morny had the
proud privilege of calling himself a doubly illegitimate
grandson of Talleyrand, an illegitimate
Beauharnais, an illegitimate Flahault and a natural
brother of Napoleon III. A highly satisfactory
pedigree, in truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appeared at first as though Joseph Bonaparte
would have better fortune than Lucien or Louis.
He had already held positions of great responsibility
as Ambassador and Plenipotentiary, and in 1806 he
became King of Naples. His rule at first was
precarious, for although many of the Neapolitans
acquiesced in his elevation, the English, and the
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
Bourbons who still held Sicily did their best to
make him as uncomfortable as possible. By landing
banditti, galley-slaves and unpleasant characters
generally, they kept Calabria in a blaze. A small
English force was landed, won a battle at Maida,
and then had to retire. But with fifty thousand
Frenchmen at his back Joseph gradually wore down
opposition and established himself more or less firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, this had hardly been accomplished
when in 1808 he was suddenly called back to France
and proclaimed King of Spain and the Indies. As
regards the Indies, Joseph was divided from them
by the British fleet, and if the fleet could preserve
Sicily for the Italian Bourbons, it could most
certainly preserve America for the Spanish ones.
The Atlantic is a good deal wider than the Straits
of Messina. As regards Spain the position was only
not quite so difficult. The whole country was in
rebellion, it is true; three weeks before the streets
of Madrid had run knee-deep with the blood of
Spaniards and Frenchmen. Some thirty thousand
of his subjects had to be beaten in a pitched battle
before Joseph could enter his capital, but Napoleon
promised him two hundred thousand French soldiers
to support him, and Joseph, a little bewildered, a
little timorous, proceeded with the adventure. He
reached Madrid, and sent his armies forward to
subdue his kingdom. In three weeks one army,
under Moncey, had been beaten back from Valencia
with ruinous losses, while twenty thousand men
under Dupont were hemmed in at Baylen and compelled
to surrender. A hundred thousand Spaniards
were marching on Madrid, and the King of Spain
returned with all speed to the security of the French
armies on the Ebro. Another battle had to be
fought before this sanctuary could be gained.
Immediately afterwards came the news that the
pestilent English, for ever intruding themselves
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
uninvited, had landed in Portugal, beaten Junot
and cleared Portugal of the French by the
Convention of Cintra. Napoleon at this moment
was at the Conference of Erfurt, trying to disentangle
the politics of Russia, Austria, Prussia and
the Rhenish Confederation, but as soon as he could,
he ended this meeting, issued a few hasty orders to
organize his army against a probable attack by
Austria in the spring, and rushed back across
Europe bent upon settling the affair out of hand.
Calling up eighty thousand more troops, he pushed
suddenly over the Ebro. The Spanish armies were
shattered in three battles at Gamonal, Espinosa
and Tudela. Once more Joseph was established in
Madrid, but the English again interfered. A skilful
thrust by Sir John Moore against the French communications
led to the French armies being wheeled
against him instead of pushing on to complete the
overthrow of the Spaniards. In the middle of this
movement Napoleon was called back to Paris on
account of the Austrian trouble and the plottings
of Talleyrand and Fouché; Joseph was left in
Madrid, King of a country ablaze with rebellion,
and commander of an army openly contemptuous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph bore his troubles for five years. Madrid
and its environs were just able to bear the expense
of his guard and his court; the rest of the country
was parcelled out among French generals who ruled
their districts despotically as far as the English and
the partidas would allow them. Joseph simply did
not count; his pathetic appeals to his protectors to
combine as he wished were disregarded. Time and
again he asked Napoleon either to give him full
power or to relieve him of the burden of his mock
sovereignty, but Napoleon bullied him into continuing
with the farce. In 1812 he lost Madrid for
a time, and in 1813 he lost all Spain. He gathered
together all his possessions, and tried to retire in
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
as dignified a fashion as possible. Forced by
Wellington to fight at Vittoria, he was badly
beaten and driven off his line of communications.
Everything had to be abandoned. During the
flight Joseph left his carriage by one door while
the English Hussars entered it by the other, pistol
shots were fired at him, and altogether he was hardly
treated with the dignity a King deserves. All his
court paraphernalia was captured by the English.
His carriage was found stuffed with masterpieces;
he lost gold to the value of a million sterling, and his
plate, his personal belongings, and his lady friends
were alike left behind. Soult at last arrived to
hold the line of the Pyrenees, and Joseph was
ignominiously thrust aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pathetically re-entered the limelight in Paris
during the fatal early months of 1814, but he was no
longer taken seriously. A proclamation of his to the
people of Paris, practically telling them to have no
fear for he was with them was received with howls
of derision. He pottered helplessly about until the
abdication, he figured inconspicuously in the last
gathering of the Bonaparte clan during the Hundred
Days, and then went off to America. He shook
from his shoulders with relief the burden of kingship.
As with his brothers, feeble novels and the
study of literature engaged his attention from 1815
until his death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A third brother of Napoleon’s was also a king;
he also was thrust on to an unwilling people, and he
also was thrust off again in course of time. Jerome
was the hope of the family; in 1801, at the age of
seventeen, he appeared to give promise of great gifts.
Napoleon sent him off to join the navy and to
acquire manhood in that hardest of all schools.
The First Consul’s plan was defeated, for the
officers of the squadron hastened to make the great
man’s young brother as comfortable as possible.

<p class='pindent'>When Gantheaume, with vastly superior numbers,
fell in with and captured the English <span class='it'>Swiftsure</span>,
Jerome (seventeen years old, if you please) was sent
to receive the English captain’s sword. On the
West Indian station the French admiral bluntly
told Jerome that he was bound to become an
admiral anyway, and he should work hard, not to
achieve promotion but to be ready for it. Jerome
did not follow his advice. The renewal of war with
England in 1803 found Jerome still in the West
Indies, and he left his ship (which was subsequently
captured) and went off to the United States. At
Washington he found the French Ambassador,
Pichon, and drew lavishly on him for funds and
embarrassed the worthy man enormously. Jerome
had quite a nice little holiday in America, travelling
about from place to place, making hordes of friends,
spending thousands of dollars, and being generally
lionized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The climax was reached when at the age of
nineteen he informed the wretched Pichon that
he had just married a Miss Elizabeth Patterson,
daughter of a worthy Baltimore merchant, and
asked him for further funds to support his new
condition. Pichon was horrified. The marriage
was illegal by the law of France, it is true, but
Jerome apparently took it seriously. Napoleon
would be mad with rage. Pichon saw himself
deprived of his position and driven into exile. He
implored Jerome to go home. Jerome refused.
Pichon cut off supplies. Jerome gaily borrowed
from his new father-in-law. Then came the news
that Napoleon had proclaimed himself Emperor of
the French. Madame Jerome Bonaparte naturally
wanted to go to France as soon as possible and enjoy
her rank as an Imperial Princess. Jerome had doubts
on the subject, but at last, when his funds ran low,
he set out in one of Mr. Patterson’s ships for Lisbon
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
with his wife. At Lisbon what Jerome had feared
came about. The French consul, acting on instructions
from Paris, announced that he could give
only Jerome a passport; he could not give “Miss
Patterson” one. At first Jerome swore he would
stay by his wife, but Napoleon’s emissaries made
him tempting offers. If he abandoned Miss Patterson
he would be made an Imperial Prince; he would
have high command; he would receive at least 150,000
francs a year. Jerome succumbed. He told his
wife to travel round by sea to Amsterdam, whence
she could more easily reach Paris to join him. He
himself went direct. Naturally by Napoleon’s
orders Elizabeth was denied permission to land at
Amsterdam; she at last realized what Jerome had
done, and, as she could do nothing else, she went
to England, where she was cordially received. A
child was born to her while she was in lodgings at
Camberwell, and this son’s son was in 1906 Attorney-General
of the United States. But Elizabeth was
never recognized by the French Government as
Jerome’s wife, and eventually she went back to the
United States. There is a story that many years
after she encountered Jerome and his next wife,
Catherine of Würtemberg, in a picture gallery at
Florence. Jerome was a perfect gentleman, and
passed her by after telling Catherine who she was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Be that as it may, Jerome gained many solid
advantages from his desertion of his wife. His
debts were paid and a large income was allowed him.
He was entrusted with the command of a small naval
expedition against Algiers, and on his return to
Genoa with a few score French prisoners whom he
had released he was greeted with storms of salutes
and congratulatory addresses. From the tone of
the announcements one would gather that he had
anticipated Lord Exmouth’s feat in 1816, bombarded
the city and wrung submission from the
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
Dey by daring and courage. As a matter of fact
the prisoners had been ransomed before he even
started for a few pounds each by a French representative
sent specially over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was much the same with the West Indian
expedition which followed. Jerome certainly did
considerable damage to English commerce, and
somehow escaped the English cruisers, but the
official description of his exploits seemed to indicate
that he had almost subverted the British Empire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner was Jerome back in France than he
turned soldier. On his early naval expeditions he
had strutted about the deck in a Hussar uniform of
which he was very fond, but apparently he did not
see fit to appear before his troops in naval attire by
way of returning the compliment. Napoleon was
already planning to give Jerome a German kingdom,
and he therefore decided that the young man should
gain some military experience along with as much
military glory as possible. With Vandamme as his
adviser and a strong <span class='it'>corps d’armée</span> at his back,
Jerome plunged into Silesia. The Prussians were
stunned by the defeats of Jena and Auerstädt, and
by the relentless pursuit which had followed, and
they gave way before him with hardly a blow struck.
One or two fortresses showed signs of resistance, and
were blockaded. The remainder of the province
was soon in Jerome’s hands, and he and Vandamme
and the divisional commanders promptly enriched
themselves with plunder. Once more Jerome’s
achievements were blazoned abroad as feats of
marvellous skill. Napoleon was usually successful
in obtaining the gold of devotion in return for the
tinsel of propaganda, and now he was exerting all
his arts in his brother’s favour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon’s victory of Friedland was followed by
the Treaty of Tilsit, and one of the clauses therein
gave Westphalia to Jerome. At the mature age of
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
twenty-three the young man found himself ruler of
two millions of subjects. Moreover, he was given a
royal bride. The King of Würtemberg, it is true,
had not been a king for more than two years, but
the house of Wittelsbach could trace its ancestry
back to the time of Charlemagne. Catherine of
Würtemberg was already affianced, but at the
Emperor’s command the engagement was broken
off and Catherine was given to Jerome. Jerome’s
American marriage was declared null and void, first
by Napoleon because at the time Jerome was a
minor, and secondly by the Metropolitan of Paris,
for no particular reason. The fact that the ceremony
had been performed by a Roman Catholic archbishop
with all due regard to the forms of the Church, did
not count.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the splendours of the new marriage
were such that the old one might well be forgotten.
It took place in the gallery of Diana at the Tuileries,
and was attended by all the shining lights of the
Empire. There was a goodly assembly of Kings,
and there were Princes and Grand Dukes in dozens.
Everybody seemed to have made a special effort to
wear as much jewellery as possible, and the display
of diamond-sewn dresses and yard-long ropes of
pearls was remembered for years afterwards. The
Democratic Empire had certainly made great strides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once married, Jerome departed with his Queen
to his kingdom of Westphalia. The new state was
a curious mixture of fragments of other countries.
Hesse, Hanover, Brunswick and Prussia had all contributed
to it (unwillingly), and Calvinists and
Catholics were represented in about equal numbers
and with an equal aversion each from the other.
The whole country was ruined by prolonged military
occupation; it was loaded with debt, for Napoleon
blithely began to collect money owing to the Elector
of Hesse whom he had dispossessed; nearly one-fourth
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
of the whole area was claimed by the Emperor
to be distributed as endowments to his officers; a
huge army had to be maintained, and a French army
of occupation had to be paid and supplied; a war
contribution had to be paid to the French treasury;
and to crown it all the Continental system was slowly
crushing the life out of the industries. During the
first administrative year there was a deficit of five
million francs, and this was the smallest there was
during the whole lifetime of the country. From
then onwards the financial measures proceeded on
the well-worn way to ruin, the landmarks thereon
being forced loans, repudiation of debt, and taxes
amounting to one-half the total national income.
There is nothing remarkable in the fact that the six
years of the existence of the kingdom were marked
by two serious mutinies and three distinct rebellions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerome himself was quite indifferent to the
troubles of his people. He spent enormous amounts
on his palace at Cassel, and in addition he fell heavily
into personal debt despite a Civil List of five million
francs a year. His pleasures were, to say the least,
of a dubious sort, and we find hints everywhere that
the orgies at Cassel eclipsed even those at the
Parc-aux-Cerfs in the good old days of the Bourbon
régime. Catherine apparently made no violent
objection to this behaviour of her husband’s; the
graceless young scamp seems to have completely
bewitched her. He must have had the time of his
life during these years, despite occasional shocks
like the one he experienced when he read in the
<span class='it'>Moniteur</span> (the first indication he received) that one
quarter of his kingdom had been annexed to France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only once did Jerome appear on active service
during this period, and that was to command thirty
or forty thousand men during the Russian campaign
of 1812. He travelled with all the luxuries he could
think of, equerries, cooks, valets, barbers, mistresses,
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
until his headquarters appeared like a small town.
But the hardships of war did not last long; Jerome
was found wanting in military ability. His failure
to keep up to the difficult time-table Napoleon set
him during the advance into Lithuania led to his
being placed under Davout’s command. Neither he
nor Davout liked the arrangement, and Jerome threw
up his command and went back to Cassel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here he enjoyed himself for one more year.
Even he had flinched from reviving the old <span class='it'>droit du
seigneur</span>, but he did his best in that direction without
that amount of ceremony. But the sands were
running out as the French armies fell back from the
Niemen to the Oder, from the Oder to the Elbe, and
at last the battle of Leipzig laid open all the country
between the Elbe and the Rhine to the triumphant
Allies. The Kingdom of Westphalia vanished in a
night, like a dream; the Westphalian army went over
to the Allies <span class='it'>en bloc</span>, and Jerome returned to France
with barely two hundred men at his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hundred Days gave Jerome one last chance
of displaying his manhood, and, curiously enough,
he made the most of it. He was given command of
a division of Reille’s corps in the Waterloo campaign,
and he led it with unexpected dash and vigour. He
fought heroically at Quatre Bras, exposing himself
recklessly in the dreadful fighting in the wood. At
Waterloo he headed the attack on Hougomont, leading
assault after assault with unflinching bravery. He
was wounded, but remained in action, and at the close
of the day he was seen striving to rally his men when
they broke panic-stricken before the allied advance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Waterloo almost atones in the general estimation
for Jerome’s long and useless life. After the second
Restoration he drifted idly about Europe, accompanied
by his devoted Catherine; when the Orleans
monarchy fell he hastened back to France. Along
with Louis Napoleon he planned the <span class='it'>coup d’état</span>, and
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
for the rest of his life, until 1860, he was once
more a prominent subject of the French Empire.
Napoleon III. made him a Marshal; his son married
a princess of the house of Savoy, and he died comfortably
in bed at the age of seventy-six. He never
met with any fatal retribution for his callous desertion
of Elizabeth Patterson, or for the wild debauchery of
his youth. There seems to be no moral to attach to
the tale of his career.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the remaining descendants in the male line of
the house of Bonaparte there is little to tell. One of
them, Lucien, a grandson of Lucien, Napoleon’s
brother, rose to the eminence of Cardinal; one or
two of them have shown ability in various branches
of science; the curious tendency to literature has
repeatedly cropped out; but none of them has ever
achieved anything really striking. Their novels are
more feeble even than Garibaldi’s, while their political
achievements are of course beneath comparison.
Some of them have fought duels, and some of them
have committed manslaughter. Some of them have
even attained the dazzling heights of the French
chamber of deputies. But there is not one of them
who would receive two lines of notice in any fair-sized
book of reference were it not for his relationship
to the great Napoleon. The present head of the
house is Napoleon Victor Jerome, who married in
1910 a Coburg princess, a member of the royal family
of Belgium. He is Napoleon VI., if the principle of
legitimacy can yet be applied to the house of Bonaparte;
anyway, he shows not the least desire to
become Napoleon VI.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had Napoleon had no brothers, he would
probably have been more successful; had he had any
brothers of equal ability they would have pulled each
other down in Europe, if they had not cut each
other’s throats years before in Corsica; as it is, he
stands as unique in his family as he does in his age.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>SISTERS</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>F Napoleon’s brothers were all a generally hopeless
lot, the same can by no means be said of
his sisters. These stood out head and shoulders
above the other women of the time; they were all
distinguished by their force of character; whether
they were married to nonentities or personalities they
all did their best to wear the breeches—but they did
not flinch from wearing nothing at all if the whim
took them. They were all handsome women, and
one of them, Pauline, was generally considered to be
the most beautiful woman of the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon’s sisters resembled him much more
closely than did his brothers. Xerxes, watching
Artemisia fighting desperately at Salamis, exclaimed,
“This woman plays the man while my men play the
woman,” and a dispassionate observer of the conduct
of the rulers of the countries of Europe in the
Napoleonic era might well say the same. One has
only to compare Joseph Bonaparte flying from
Vittoria, or Murat flying from Tolentino, with
Caroline rallying the Neapolitans, Louise of Prussia
fighting desperately hard against fate at Tilsit, and
Marie Caroline of Bourbon directing Sicily’s struggle
with the great conqueror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are obvious differences, too, between
Napoleon’s treatment of his brothers and his treatment
of his sisters. Joseph and Jerome and Louis
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
he bullied unmercifully, but it was far otherwise with
Pauline, Caroline and Elise. He himself admitted
that he always “formed into line of battle” in preparation
for an interview with Caroline, and although
authorities are at variance as to when he actually said
to his family that anyone would think he was trying
to rob them of the inheritance of the late King,
their father, it is certain that the remark was
addressed to his sisters and mother. They were all
of them women with a very keen sense of what they
wanted, and they fought like tiger-cats to obtain it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three girls all married before or during the
Consulate, when Napoleon had not yet attained the
heights he reached later, so that the marriages they
made were by no means as brilliant as they might
have been, and fell far short of the marriages which
Napoleon arranged for much more distant relatives
who became marriageable at a later period. Elise
was old enough to experience acutely the trials of
poverty which overtook the family before Napoleon
was promoted to important commands. She was
sent as a child to school at St. Cyr, a state-supported
institution under the patronage of the Bourbons, and
had to leave there at the same time as the Bonaparte
family had to fly from Corsica to Marseilles. During
the next few years she was rather a trial to her
family, for she flirted with every man she met, eligible
and ineligible. One of her admirers was Admiral
Truguet, who was a thoroughly good sailor and quite
a good match at that time, but Madame Bonaparte
declined to allow the affair to develop. In the end
it was a fellow Corsican, Félix Baciocchi, who gained
her hand. Baciocchi was a distant connection of the
Bonaparte family, and also, by a curious coincidence,
he was a relation of Charles Andrea Pozzo di Borgo,
another Corsican, who is believed to have been at
feud with the Bonapartes, and who certainly distinguished
himself, while in the service of various
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
European monarchs, by his virulent hatred of
Napoleon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Baciocchi did not distinguish himself at all.
He was a complete nonentity, with neither the desire
nor the capacity to achieve power. At the marriage
Elise only brought him thirty thousand francs as
dowry (her share of the Bonaparte property, now
recovered from the Paolists), but after 1797 Napoleon
was able to make Elise presents of considerably
greater value. Baciocchi was then a major of
infantry; but during the Consulate his wife
endeavoured to obtain higher military command
for him. So persistently did she scheme to this
end that at last in self-defence Napoleon made him
a senator in order to cut short his military career.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pauline, the next sister, married Leclerc, a
capable soldier, who rendered Napoleon valuable
service during the <span class='it'>coup d’état</span> of Brumaire. He, at
least, was worthy of promotion, and Bonaparte gave
it to him lavishly. But it was Caroline, the youngest,
who looked after herself best. Most of the generals
of the Consulate sought her hand, including Lannes,
but both Napoleon and Caroline desired alliance with
the greatest of them all, Moreau. However, Moreau
declined the honour (thereby directly bringing about
his own exile soon after), and Caroline chose for
herself a husband of whose military talents she was
sufficiently sure to be certain that high command
would be given him, but who also was sufficiently
weak-willed to be well under her thumb. Lannes
was of too lofty a type to please her in this
respect, and his personal devotion to Napoleon was
undoubted; Caroline therefore selected a young
cavalry officer, Murat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pauline experienced an unfortunate beginning to
the career she had planned for herself and her
husband. Leclerc was appointed to the command of
the expeditionary force which was sent to subdue
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
Hayti, and Pauline was ordered to accompany him.
In vain she pleaded ill-health; in vain she said that
her complexion would be ruined by the West Indian
sun; Napoleon was adamant. Pauline kept up the
plea of ill-health sufficiently well to be carried on
board ship at Brest in a litter, but the expedition
started. As was only to be expected, it ended in
disastrous failure. Toussaint l’Ouverture, the leader
of the rebellion, was indeed captured and sent to
France to perish in a freezing mountain prison, but
yellow fever attacked the French troops, and they
died in thousands. Leclerc was one of those who
perished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon himself was able to gain some satisfaction
even from the failure, because the men he had
sent had all been drawn from the Army of the Rhine,
and they were all guilty of the crime of believing that
Moreau was a great man, and that Hohenlinden was
a greater victory than Marengo. But, as has been
said, the French died in thousands; the negroes
fought stoutly, and at last after fifteen thousand
Frenchmen had perished only a miserable fragment
of the expeditionary force survived to be withdrawn
under Rochambeau. Pauline returned to France to
deplore her ruined complexion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, with the establishment of the Empire
the sisters found plenty to occupy their minds in
acquiring as much spoil as possible. Money they
sought greedily, and Napoleon gave them millions of
francs. They shed tears of rage when they found
that the Emperor expected them to remain content
with being plain Mesdames Murat, Leclerc and
Baciocchi, while the hated Josephine was Sa Majesté
Impériale et Royale l’Impératrice et Reine, and
while plain Julie Clary and Hortense Beauharnais
(Joseph’s and Louis’s wives) were Imperial and Royal
Highnesses. Napoleon gave way to their bitter
pleadings and at one stroke created them Princesses
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
of the Empire, making their husbands Princes at the
same time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These names, Elise, Pauline and Caroline, were
not the baptismal names of the ladies concerned. At
baptism they had been given Italian names, each of
them attached to the ever popular name of Maria.
Their mother was Maria Letizia; while Elise was
really Maria Anna, Pauline, Maria Paoletta and
Caroline, Maria Annunziata. It is by these names
that they are described on their marriage certificates,
but they dropped them soon afterwards to assume
names which appealed to them more. Changing
their names did not change their natures; they
intrigued and schemed and plotted; they flirted; they
sought favours; they quarrelled with their husbands,
with their sisters-in-law, and with each other; in fact
they exhibited all the fierce self-seeking which
characterized the ladies of the old monarchy. There
was this difference, however. Fifty years before the
Court ladies had intrigued for places, and for
thousands of francs. Now they intrigued for
kingdoms and millions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caroline early took first place in the race for
power. Her husband, Murat, distinguished himself
in the Austerlitz campaign by capturing the great
bridge over the Danube by a trick which savoured
rather of treachery, and by bold heading of cavalry
charges at Austerlitz itself. He was already a Prince
and second senior Marshal of the Empire; the only
possible promotion left for him was a sovereignty.
Napoleon, carving out his Confederation of the
Rhine, found him one. A tiny area on the Rhine
was obtained by exchange from Prussia and Bavaria,
and Murat and Caroline became Grand Duke and
Grand Duchess of Berg and Cleves. Caroline was
in no way satisfied. She egged her husband on to
demand increases of territory, privileges of toll on
the Rhine, and so on, until the little state had set
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
both France and Prussia in a ferment. The tension
hardly relaxed until, a month or two later, war broke
out between the two countries. Murat went away
with the Grand Army to Jena, Eylau and Friedland;
Caroline stayed behind in Paris to guard their
interests. She did it well. She indulged in an outrageous
flirtation with Junot, Governor of Paris,
and hints have not been wanting that her purpose
was to arrange a revolution rather on the same lines
as Mallet tried to follow in 1812. At her palace of
the Elysée (now the official residence of the President
of the Third Republic) she gave the most brilliant
fêtes imaginable. She worked like a slave to gain
popularity, so that she could gain the throne in the
event of her brother’s death. Then Tilsit followed
Friedland, and the Emperor returned. The
campaign had brought more glory to Murat than
he had as yet gained. He had headed the marvellous
pursuit after Jena, when he had captured fortresses
with a few regiments of Hussars, and it was largely
through him that practically the whole Prussian army
had fallen into the hands of the French. At Eylau,
when Augereau’s corps had come reeling back
through the blizzard, shattered and almost annihilated,
when it seemed as though the Grand Army
was at last going to taste defeat, Napoleon had called
on Murat to save the day. Murat replied by charging
at the head of eighteen thousand cavalry. He
broke up the first Russian line, captured thousands
of prisoners, and beat back the Russians until Davout
and Ney were in position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally, he reaped vast rewards. His Grand
Duchy was doubled in size; millions of francs were
bestowed upon him and upon Caroline; but they
were hugely dissatisfied. Murat had hoped for the
crown of Poland, or, failing that, for a whole
kingdom in Germany. But Poland was given to the
King of Saxony, and the creation of Jerome Bonaparte’s
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
kingdom of Westphalia shut out all hopes of
the further expansion of Berg. Caroline and Murat
were furious. Murat showed his rage by hinting at
rebellion; Caroline used her native Corsican guile and
became as friendly to Napoleon as possible, helping
him in his affairs with women, recounting to him the
tittle-tattle of the drawing-rooms of Paris, and even
at times giving him the shelter of her roof to conceal
from Josephine some of his more flagrant unfaithfulnesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, Murat was soon in employment again.
He was appointed to the command in Spain,
where Napoleon’s tortuous intrigues to dispossess
the unspeakable Bourbons were beginning to take
effect. Murat certainly achieved fair success. He
gained possession of the Spanish fortresses, stamped
out the little spurts of rebellion which occasionally
flamed out, and by the time the outrageous treaty of
Bayonne had been signed he was in a position to
hand over to Napoleon the greater part of the
country. Another disappointment awaited him.
He had hoped that all this mysterious business would
result in his being given the crown of Spain—but
Joseph Bonaparte received it instead, and Murat and
Caroline were forced to be content with Joseph’s
former kingdom of Naples. Caroline was at last a
Queen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The royal pair began at once to treat their new
kingdom much as Sancho Panza had determined to
treat his island. Taxes were increased, the army
was reorganized, and preparations were set on foot
for the conquest of Sicily. To gain popularity with
the Neapolitans they abrogated some of the more
obnoxious decrees of Murat’s predecessor, and they
further employed all their arts to blacken his memory,
so that they would by contrast appear the better
rulers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Napoleon nipped this scheme in the bud at
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
once. Every day brought fresh thunders from Paris.
The Emperor sent furious orders forbidding certain
measures, enjoining others, until it became very
evident that he was determined to rule Naples himself,
although he was content to allow Murat to bear
the title and honours of King. Poor Murat could
do nothing right. Any well-advised action on his
part was looked upon as potential treason, while any
failure called forth tornadoes of wrath from Paris.
When, by a well-planned raid, he captured Capri
from Sir Hudson Lowe, he was actually censured
for informing the Emperor through the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs instead of through the Ministry for
War! Murat and Caroline chafed against their
bonds, but while the Empire stood firm they were
powerless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, Pauline and Elise, although not as
successful as Caroline, had nevertheless attained to
some measure of sovereignty. Elise contrived for
the greater part of the time to have her dullard
husband sent away on various duties, while she herself
flirted gaily with every man she could. As a
matter of fact, her flirting was never so serious as was
her sisters’; she had another outlet for her ingenuity
in that she was passionately devoted to the stage and
to all connected with it. She visited the theatre as
often as she could; she read plays in hundreds, and
she indulged in amateur theatricals whenever possible.
When Italy was being parcelled out into fiefs by
Napoleon, she prevailed on her brother to allot to
her the principality of Piombino in full sovereignty,
and later she contrived to have Lucca added to her
little state. Here she settled down for a time, with
all the paraphernalia of sovereignty, equerries,
chamberlains, ladies-in-waiting, and especially a
Court troupe of actors. Baciocchi, her husband, had
indeed been given the title of Prince of Piombino,
but Elise alone had been given the principality.
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
Baciocchi was merely his wife’s subject, and Elise
made the most of it. He could never worry her
again, for Elise allotted him apartments far distant
from her own, and never saw him without a third
person being present. Scandal said that other men
were allowed greater privileges, but there is nothing
very definite from which one may draw reliable
conclusions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon Elise received further promotion. Napoleon
cast a covetous eye upon the kingdom of Etruria
which had set up in 1802, and by treaty with Spain
he arranged to give the widowed Queen of Etruria
(a Spanish princess) a new kingdom of Northern
Lusitania in exchange. That this new kingdom was
to be carved out of Portugal troubled him not at all;
he even promised to make Godoy (First Minister of
Spain) Prince of the Algarve, another Portuguese
district. He had very little intention of fulfilling
either promise, but they enabled him to send Junot
marching hotfoot on Lisbon, and to annex Tuscany
to the Empire. Elise seized her opportunity. By
cajolery and blandishment she persuaded Napoleon
to erect Tuscany into a government-general, and to
confer upon her the ruling power with the title of
Grand Duchess of Tuscany. Poor Baciocchi was
appointed general of division in command of the
French garrison. Elise settled down in the Pitti
palace at Florence, and proceeded to rule the cradle
of the Renaissance, the erstwhile domain of the
Medicis, as thoroughly as her brother would allow
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pauline’s widowhood ended in a much more
splendid match than was made by any of the other
Bonapartes. She took as her second husband Prince
Camillo Borghese, the head of one of the most
renowned houses of Italy. The marriage was not
a success (no Bonaparte marriage was, at that time),
but Borghese’s wealth and the presents Napoleon
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
heaped upon her enabled Pauline to indulge every
whim of which she was capable. Proud of her
reputation as the most beautiful woman of the time,
she did all she could to enhance and set off her
beauty. Like Poppæa, she bathed every day in
milk—a hot milk bath followed by a cold milk
shower. She surrounded herself with negro servants
and dwarfs, by way of contrast, and her extravagances
and wanton waste of money were the talk of
the whole Empire. Canova carved her statue, and
despite his cold classicism we can still perceive in
that recumbent, self-satisfied figure the fiery, tempestuous
woman who was once Pauline. Her posing
semi-nude, even to such a sculptor as Canova, called
forth a storm of comment from a gossip-loving
Empire. The tale was told that when Pauline was
asked if she did not feel uncomfortable, posing half-dressed,
she replied, “Oh no, there was a fire in the
room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Elise received Piombino, Pauline begged
Guastalla from Napoleon, and as Duchess she, too,
held sovereignty. Borghese was made Governor-General
of the Piedmontese departments, and was
sent to Turin with an enormous Civil List to play
the part of a semi-royalty, and to reconcile the Piedmontese
to the loss of their Sardinian king. Such a
task was naturally agreeable to Pauline, and in Turin
she and Borghese did their best to astonish the provincials
with a series of fêtes of unheard-of opulence.
Pauline was the most talked about of all Bonaparte’s
sisters; the voice of adulation praised her beauty; the
voice of vituperation hinted frightful things about
her morals. She was accused of hideous vices, of too
great an affection for her brothers, of a lunatic
passion for various men. Pauline apparently did not
mind. She went gaily on through life, quarrelling
with Borghese, spending money like water, indulging
in hectic episodes with artists and soldiers, and
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
generally recalling to mind the old days of the
Borgias and the Viscontis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the publication of the fate of Napoleon’s
Russian expedition a shudder ran through the
Empire. Murat, whom Napoleon had left in command
of the wreck of the Grand Army, deserted his
charge and rushed home so as to be at hand to
preserve his own kingdom should the Empire fall.
Prussia became Russia’s ally. Sweden, under Bernadotte,
had already done the same. Napoleon made
a gigantic effort; in three months he raised and
equipped an army of three hundred thousand men;
he beat back the Allies, winning victories at Lützen
and Bautzen; for a space it seemed as if he would
regain his old European domination. Consequently
the pendulum of his allies’ attitude swung back once
more towards faithfulness, and Murat left Naples
once more to command the cavalry of the Grand
Army. But already Caroline and he had negotiated
a secret convention with Austria by which he would
declare war on France if called upon to do so. Elise
in Tuscany had decided to join him, although,
unfortunately for her, she extracted no definite
promise from Austria that she would retain her
throne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, while Murat was fighting for the Grand
Army, leading charges made by fifty and seventy
squadrons at a time, and capturing twelve thousand
Austrian prisoners in a single battle, his wife in
Naples was assuring Austria of his devotion to
Austria; she was recruiting the Neapolitan army to
the utmost, and, while not actually moving against
France, she was refusing to allow a single Neapolitan
battalion to go to Napoleon’s help. Then came the
French defeats of 1813, culminating in the disaster
of Leipzig. It was obvious that the Empire could
not endure much longer. Bavaria, Baden, Würtemberg,
all turned against Napoleon, and Murat realized
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
that if he delayed further the Allies would not have
so pressing a need for his aid, and he would be
unable to secure his throne by his treachery. Without
further hesitation he left the beaten Emperor,
hurried across Europe through the first snows of
autumn, and reached Naples early in November.
The Neapolitan army was at last going to advance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The advance was a very slow and cautious one.
Eugène de Beauharnais, Viceroy of Italy, was
fighting fiercely in Venetia against the Austrians.
Tempting offers were made to him by the Allies,
but he refused them; his dignified replies are
worthy of Bayard or Francis I. But Murat and
his Neapolitans were moving steadily northward;
even now he had made no public declaration as to
which side he was on, and in private he and Caroline
were assuring Eugène, Napoleon and the Austrians
at one and the same time of their unfailing support.
Nor was this all. They were further intriguing
with the infant United Italy party in an endeavour
to increase their dominion in that way; while in
addition they had made some sort of agreement with
Elise Bonaparte in Tuscany. It would be hard to
discover anywhere in history an equally loathsome
example of double-dealing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murat occupied the Papal States, Tuscany, and
portions of the Kingdom of Italy, but he still
refrained from making any open attack on either
French or Austrians. Not until March 6th, 1814,
when he received from Caroline definite news of the
certainty of the fall of the Empire, did he attack
Eugène’s forces. He achieved little, and after two
fierce little skirmishes he subsided once more into
inaction. At last official intimation of Napoleon’s
fall came to hand, and, abandoning Elise to her fate,
Murat returned to Naples. Further diplomacy confirmed
him in his possession of Naples; the only
person concerned who kept to his pledged word in
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
all the intricacies of the negotiations was Francis of
Austria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus 1815 found Napoleon’s three sisters in very
different situations. Caroline was still a Queen;
Elise, turned out of Tuscany by the Austrians, was
a pensioner on her bounty; while Pauline, who alone
had remained faithful to her brother, was living with
Napoleon at Elba. Suddenly there came another
dramatic change, for Napoleon escaped from Elba,
and within a few days was once more Emperor of
the French. Italy was again plunged into a ferment.
Murat and Caroline were naturally anxious, for they
could not expect that Napoleon would forgive their
black treachery of the year before, while it was only
too obvious that not a single country in Europe
retained any interest in their possession of the
throne of Naples. In these circumstances Murat
took the first heroic decision of his life, and decided
to cut the Gordian knot by force of arms. He
declared war against Austria, proclaimed a United
Italy, and with fifty thousand men he marched
northward to establish himself as King of Italy. It
was a vain effort. The Neapolitan army was a
wretched force, and Murat himself was worse than
useless in independent command. The Austrian
army hurriedly concentrated, defeated Murat in
one or two minor actions, and finally utterly routed
him at Tolentino. The Neapolitans deserted in
thousands, and Murat re-entered his dominions with
only five thousand men left. The Austrians followed
him up remorselessly; the Sicilians were preparing
an expedition against him; and all that was left for
Murat to do was to abdicate and fly for his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caroline was successful in obtaining the protection
of Francis of Austria, and she soon went
off to settle down in Austria with a pension and
a residence. Murat had reached France, and for
some weeks he was in hiding in Marseilles. After
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
Waterloo he left by sea to join his wife, but on his
way he changed his mind and took his second heroic
decision. Napoleon had regained France simply by
appearing in person before his army; why should
not Murat regain Naples in the same way? Murat
landed with a score of companions at Pizzo in
Calabria, and marched into the market place with
his escort shouting “Long live King Joachim!”
For a moment there was an astonished silence, and
then the townspeople fell on the little party. Not
for nothing had Murat decorated every mile of every
road in Calabria with a gallows from which hung
captured bandits; every soul in Pizzo must have
had a blood feud with their late King. Battered
with sticks and stones, Murat was seized and flung
into prison, and five days later he was tried and shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murat’s attempt was the last spurt of the
Napoleonic feeling for a long period. Not until,
with the passage of years, the Legend had been
built up, do we hear of any surprising action or
heroic deed. Europe sank into a slough of inaction,
crushed down by the weight of the Holy Alliance
and the burden of accumulated debts. The most
typical action of a dull generation was the establishment
on the throne of France of fat, pathetic,
bourgeois Louis Philippe as King of the French.
It was a safe thing to do, and Louis Philippe and his
Amelia did their best to make it remain safe. No
risks were taken until the movement of 1848.
Happiness has no history, and there is precious
little history about the period 1815-48. Had the
Holy Alliance had its way, there would be even less.
Somehow one cannot help feeling that the dullness
of the period is the dullness of unhappiness. It was
the time when “order reigned in Warsaw,” when
little children died in droves in English factories,
when in Naples the negation of God was erected
into a system of government. Historians may sneer
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
at the ineffectiveness of the Napoleonides; they
may point to a pillaged, blood-drenched Europe
writhing under the heel of a Corsican Emperor;
they can draw horrible pictures of the sacks of
Lübeck or Badajoz, but they are unconvincing
when they attempt to prove that there was more
unhappiness under the Empire than under the Holy
Alliance. Peace has its defeats as well as war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This digression may be unpardonable, but it was
nevertheless inevitable. Let us minimize our error,
even if we cannot repair it, by turning back to the
consideration of three fair and frail women whom we
left thrust back unwillingly into a private station of
life. One of them did not long survive the calamities
of 1814. This was Elise. The Allies refused
her request to join Napoleon at St. Helena, and she
lived quietly in Italy until her death in 1820. She
was only forty-two when she died. Pauline had the
advantage over her sisters of having a husband whose
position was independent of the Empire. Prince
Borghese was a very considerable person in Rome,
and Pauline for some time was a leading figure in
Italian society. It did not last long, however. She
quarrelled with her husband; her beauty left her;
Austrian, French and Papal surveillance worried
her, and she died in 1825.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caroline, the most capable and cold-hearted of
all the Bonapartes, after Napoleon, bore her troubles
with more dignity and for a much longer time. As
the Countess of Lipona (an anagram of Napoli) she
lived for some time in Austria; she travelled restlessly
about; she seemed in fact to have completely
recovered from the shock of the loss of her husband
and her throne, when at last a whole series of deaths
broke down her reserve and shortened her life.
Pauline and Elise, as has been said, were already
dead; in 1832 the Prince Imperial (Napoleon II.)
died at Vienna; Prince Borghese died in the same
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
year. Another brother-in-law, Baciocchi, died in
1834; Catherine of Westphalia, her best beloved
sister-in-law, died in 1835, and then in 1836 Madame
Mère, her stern but adored mother, also died.
Caroline endured her loneliness for a little while
longer, but she died in 1839. Even she, almost the
last of her generation, was only fifty-six at her
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None of the Bonaparte family was as long-lived
as Napoleon’s mother. Maria Letizia Ramolino was
certainly one of the greatest women of the period.
Elise Bonaparte might be called the Semiramis of
Italy; Caroline might intrigue for Empires; Pauline
might be the most beautiful woman of France; but
their mother combined all their good qualities with
very few of their bad ones. To bring up a family of
eight children thoroughly well on an income of less
than one hundred pounds a year in a revolution-torn
country like Corsica is in itself a remarkable feat,
though hardly likely in unfavourable circumstances
to gain mention in history, but to do it when handicapped
by a husband like Carlo Bonaparte is more
remarkable still. The strain of those dreadful years
in Ajaccio would have broken down anyone of stuff
less stern than Maria Letizia’s; pitched battles were
fought in the streets outside the Bonapartes’ house;
three-quarters of Corsica were at feud with the
Bonapartes and the party they represented; death
threatened them all at different times, while all the
time a most bitter, grinding poverty harried them
unmercifully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maria Letizia came through the ordeal unbroken
in body or spirit. Even Napoleon’s fierce pride
humbled itself before her, and her other children
were her slaves. But she had a woman’s weaknesses
as well as a man’s strength. She was bitterly jealous
of her daughter-in-law Josephine; she was bigoted
in church matters; and she fought like a tigress in
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>
the cause of whichever of her children was experiencing
misfortune. When Lucien left France in
disgrace in consequence of his marriage to Madame
Jouberthon, his mother strove desperately hard to
re-establish him. She went to Italy to be near him,
and endeavoured, by absenting herself at the time
of the coronation, to force Napoleon to recall Lucien
and herself together. However, her great son outwitted
her on this occasion, for he dispensed with
her presence, and yet arranged with David the
artist for her portrait to appear along with the other
French dignitaries in the celebrated picture of the
coronation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Letizia had a very good opinion of her own
position. When Napoleon became Emperor, and
made his brothers and sisters Imperial Highnesses,
she demanded some greater title for herself.
Napoleon was in a quandary, for on consulting
precedents he found that no French king’s mother
had ever been given any such honour if she had
never been queen. Letizia insisted, and, almost at
his wits’ end, Napoleon at last gave her a singular
dignity. He awarded her the same position and
precedence as used to be given under the Bourbons
to the wife of the king’s second son. The king’s
second son was Monsieur, and his wife was Madame.
Letizia was named Madame, and as a subsidiary title
she was called Mère de S.M. l’Empéreur et Roi.
Almost at once the titles were merged together in
common speech, and Letizia was called Madame
Mère everywhere except at strict official gatherings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time that the Empire was firmly founded,
and all her children except Lucien were seated on
thrones, Letizia was able to give free rein to the
passion which came only second with her to her love
for her children. It is said that shipwrecked sailors
who have been starved for a long time cannot help,
after being rescued, hoarding fragments of food for
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>
fear of another period of famine. With Madame
Mère a similar state of affairs prevailed. She had
felt the pinch of poverty for fifty years, and in no
circumstances could she endure it again. She still
lived as cheaply as she could, and she saved her
money like a miser. She coaxed Napoleon into
giving her an annual income of a million francs, and
she did not spend a quarter of it. She did her best
to obtain a sovereignty for herself, not that she
wanted to rule, but because she could sell the fief
back to the French and invest the proceeds. She
made money by acute speculation. She clung like
grim death to every sou which came within her reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet avarice pure and simple was not the sole
motive of her actions. Just as a prophet has no
honour in his own country, so the Emperor and the
Kings and Princesses who were her children still
seemed to be children to her, and all their talk of
sovereignty was little better than childish prattling.
She did not believe for one moment that the Empire
could long endure, and in this her judgment was
more acute than that of the majority of European
statesmen. Wellington, as early as 1809, had seen
through the shams and pretences of the glittering
Empire, but few other men, not even Metternich,
agreed with him at that time. But Madame Mère
saw the end long before it came, and it was against
that time of need that she saved so avariciously.
Her judgment was proved accurate, and her savings
proved useful in 1814.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1802 she had befriended Lucien; in 1805,
Jerome; in 1810, Louis; now the greatest of her
sons had met with adversity, and Letizia rushed to
his assistance. She shared his exile in Elba, and
from her own purse she provided the money which
enabled him to maintain his Lilliputian court. She
was by his side during the Hundred Days, and after
he had been sent to St. Helena she returned to Italy
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
and resumed the headship of the family. Her wealth
as well as her marvellous personality assured her the
respect of her sons and daughters. The death of the
Prince Imperial in 1832 was a terrible shock to her;
she had long been looking to him to restore the fame
of the exiled house, and she had arranged to leave
him all her money and papers. She did not long
survive his death, but died in 1836, at the age of
eighty-six.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lies buried in Ajaccio, and the inscription
over her tomb can still make the casual tourist catch
his breath, and still makes the blood of Corsican
youth run a little faster—</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>‟B</span>AD troops do not exist,” said Napoleon
on one occasion. “There are only bad
officers.” Napoleon did his best therefore
to find good officers, and trusted that the rank
and file would through them become good soldiers.
And yet, was he successful either in his end or in
his method? The army of 1796, which he did
not train, was timid in retreat though terrible in
advance. The men were fanatics, and similar
strengths and weaknesses are typical of fanatics in
large bodies. In 1800 Napoleon had an army which
he could manœuvre in line, and which bore the
dreadful strain of Marengo without breaking. Half
the men in the ranks, however, were untrained boys,
who, as Napoleon’s despatches tell us, were ignorant
a few days before the battle as to which eye they
should use to aim their muskets. Marengo was
largely a personal triumph for Napoleon; it was his
vehement encouragement, coupled with the confident
expectation of Desaix’ arrival, which held the men
together during that long-drawn agony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peace which followed Hohenlinden gave
Napoleon a chance to train an army as he wished,
and the Austerlitz campaign found him at the head
of an army of two hundred thousand men, half of
them veterans, all of them of very considerable
length of service, who were to a man inspired with
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
the utmost enthusiasm for him and for the Empire.
Yet at Austerlitz the line was abandoned almost
entirely in favour of the column; the columns showed
evident signs of disintegration even when victorious.
It was already a little obvious that the Imperial
armies were only adapted to a furious offensive
effort, and that failure of this effort meant unlimited
catastrophe. At Jena the Prussians were too heavily
outnumbered to offer any serious resistance, but at
Eylau the French army was only saved from destruction
after the failure of their first offensive
by the fact that Napoleon held ready at hand
eighteen thousand cavalry, and by the constitutional
sluggishness of the Russian army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Friedland offered the last example of a really
heroic defensive by an Imperial force, but the soul
of that defensive was Lannes. Few other men
could have held a French army corps together
against superior forces as did Lannes on that
fateful anniversary of Marengo. After Friedland
we find the French army growing progressively
poorer and more unreliable. We read of panics
at Wagram, of the introduction of regimental
artillery to give the infantry confidence, of shameless
skulking on the field of battle and of heavy
desertion while on the march. Discipline was
fading at the same time as devotion to the
Emperor was losing some of its force. In the
Russian campaign of 1812 the Grand Army had
barely crossed the frontier before it began to go
to pieces. Napoleon could not trust his men to
manœuvre at Borodino, and in consequence he had
to rely on frontal attacks made against elaborate
fieldworks defended by the most stubborn of all
Continental infantry. At the crisis of the battle
he refused to fling the Imperial Guard into the
struggle; some thought it was because he was too
far from his base to risk his best reserve; some
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
suspected Bessières of having implored him not to
waste his best troops; but perhaps the reason was
a more logical one. Had the Guard been sent
forward and been beaten back, the whole army
would have fallen back routed; at Waterloo
Napoleon took the risk and lost; at Borodino he
refused to take it and was satisfied with an indecisive
gain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Grand Army perished in Russia, but in
three months Napoleon raised, trained and equipped
three hundred thousand more men and was for a
time once more successful. Curiously enough, this
raw infantry of 1813 was to all intents and
purposes of greater military value than the two or
three year trained infantry of 1812. The army
of 1812 possessed the little knowledge proverbially
dangerous, and would not willingly expose itself to
sacrifice, but the novices of 1813 knew nothing of
war, and suffered losses and privations which would
have roused veterans to mutiny. At Lützen Ney’s
corps of half-grown boys endured for hours the
attack of the whole Allied force, and fought like
demons in the shelter of the villages of Gorschen
and Kaya. At Bautzen the French attacked with
a dash and fury reminiscent of Elchingen or Saalfeld.
Before Dresden they accomplished a march which
easily bears comparison with anything achieved in
1796. But the decline of their fame had already
begun. At the Katzbach, at Gross Beeren, at
Dennewitz, the conscripts fled in panic. They
had discovered by this time that a battle generally
implies the sacrifice of one portion of the army while
the rest gains the victory, and they were one and all
determined not to be the sacrifice. At Leipzig
what was left of the army of 1813 lost the greater
part of its numbers—a new lesson to the effect that
it is easier to surrender than to fight had been
learned. Napoleon’s last victorious phase, in the
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
campaign of France in 1814, coincides with his
use of a fresh army of raw conscripts, and his
surrender took place when the men of the ranks had
once more learnt the lessons of their predecessors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Waterloo, the last battle of the Empire,
epitomizes all these observations. The French
attacked with dash, but a single reverse was
sufficient to weaken the infantry so much that no
support was forthcoming for the later cavalry
attacks. A powerful counter-attack by the enemy
brought about, not merely retreat, but unspeakable
panic. Practically every battalion which had been
in action broke and fled. The Guard, which had
moved forward so majestically, dispersed like the
merest conscripts. The only troops which held
together were the reserve battalions of the Old
Guard, which had not yet been engaged, and for
a time Lobau’s corps at Planchenoit. The Prussians
after Jena were not so hopelessly disorganized as
were the French after Waterloo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon undoubtedly appreciated this weakness
of his army, and this explains the reckless manner
in which he sought battle at all costs, and the risks
he cheerfully ran in his endeavour to get to grips
with his enemy. His headlong, energetic strategy
gave him the initiative, and this initiative he
retained on the field of battle. Jena, Eylau,
Eckmühl, Aspern, Wagram, Borodino, were all
examples of a fierce tactical offensive. On the two
principal occasions, at Austerlitz and Friedland,
when he confined some part of his force to a dogged
defensive, he saw that the generals in command were
men of wide personal influence, and that the troops
they led were the best available. Davout and
Lannes were certainly successful. At Lützen
Ney’s necessarily defensive rôle was not fully foreseen,
but he was able to hold on, partly through the
enthusiasm of his young men, partly through the
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
advantage they possessed in holding the villages,
and partly through Wittgenstein’s bungling of the
attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At no period in its development will Napoleon’s
army bear comparison with, say, the army of Cromwell,
or the original force of Gustavus Adolphus, or
with the army of the Third Republic. It incidentally
follows that Napoleon’s military achievements should
be rated even higher than they usually are, seeing
that the immense successes he gained were gained
with inferior troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if the rank and file were of this doubtful
quality, it was far otherwise with the officers, and
the statement of Napoleon’s with which this chapter
opens is therefore subject to doubt. Napoleon’s
method of making war support war exposed his
armies, as he candidly admitted, to a loss of one-half
of their numbers every year, and since this loss fell
far more heavily on the privates than on the officers,
it followed that a very widely experienced corps of
officers was built up. It was quite usual for men of
good birth to serve a few months in the ranks before
taking commissions; Marbot and Bugeaud are good
examples of this among the younger men. Once
they had gained their lieutenancy anything might
happen. They might in ten years be dukes and
generals, or they might still be lieutenants. The
open system of promotion was stimulating, certainly,
but it was undoubtedly unfair at times. Curély,
who served from 1800 to 1814, and was subsequently
admitted to be the best light cavalry officer in the
French service, only attained his colonelcy in his last
campaign. The men who received the most rapid
promotion were those who had attracted Napoleon’s
notice in 1796 or in the Egyptian campaign. Some
of these choices were highly successful, as witness the
career of Davout, but others were positively harmful.
Marmont was a failure, Junot was a failure,
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
Murat was a failure, while men of undoubted talent
served in twenty campaigns without receiving promotion.
Kellermann the younger fought at Waterloo
with the same military rank as he had held at
Marengo. Suchet, who was one of the most
successful generals of division in 1799, remained a
general of division until 1811. If this was the case
with the higher ranks, it must have been nearly as
bad with the lower ranks. When the rush of
promotion of the Revolutionary era ended, advancement
became very slow indeed. A man who was
a captain at the battle of the Pyramids might well
consider himself fortunate if he commanded a
battalion at Ligny. Occasionally, however, the
divisional generals were given their chance. The
vast expansion of the Imperial Army for the
Russian campaign increased the commands of
some of the Marshals to eighty or a hundred
thousand men, and generals of division similarly
found themselves at the head of twenty or thirty
thousand. Many of them displayed talents of a
very high order. St. Cyr won the battle of
Polotsk, for which he received his bâton. The
most remarkable example occurred at Salamanca.
Here Wellington had flung himself suddenly on
the over-extended Army of Portugal, had shattered
one wing, and had beaten back the remainder in
dire confusion; Marmont, the commander-in-chief,
was badly wounded. Bonnet had hardly succeeded
to the command when he was killed. Several other
generals of division were struck down. The man
who took over command of the fleeing mob was
already wounded. He was practically unknown;
he was leading a beaten army in wild retreat from
the finest troops in the world. And yet he rallied
that beaten army; in the course of a few hours he
had them once more in hand. He faced about time
and again as he toiled across the wasted Castilian
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
plains; in a dozen fierce rearguard actions he
taught the exultant English that some Frenchmen,
as well as being more than men in victory, were not
less than women in defeat, and he showed Wellington
that every French general was not a Marmont.
Every morning found his army posted in some
strong position; all day long the English marched
by wretched roads and over thirsty plains to turn
the flanks; every evening as the movement was
nearing completion the French fell back to some
new position where the English had to resume the
whole weary business next day. The French survived
the severest defeat they had yet received in
the Peninsula at English hands with astonishingly
little loss; a few weeks later they had so far recovered
as to thrust fiercely forward once more, and aid in
driving Wellington from Madrid. The man who
was responsible for this wonderful achievement
deserved reward. Bessières and Marmont had been
given bâtons for much less. A title, a marshalate,
a dotation of a million francs would not have
seemed too much for saving for France a kingdom,
an army of forty thousand men, and dependent
forces numbering a quarter of a million. But
Clausel was not made Marshal, nor Duke of Burgos.
Instead he was recalled, and an inferior general,
Souham, sent in his place. Napoleon had a
prejudice against “retreating generals” dating
from the days of Moreau. Clausel took the affront
philosophically, and fought on for his Emperor.
When it was too late, his worth was recognized,
and during the Hundred Days he was given the
independent command of the Pyrenees. After
Waterloo he fled from France with a price on
his head. Clausel went unrewarded; Murat was
over-rewarded. Their lines of conduct differed
greatly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men who were never granted the coveted
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
rank of Marshal, but who did each as much for
France as any one of half the Marshals, are in
number legion. Their very names would fill a page.
Kellermann the younger has already been mentioned.
At Marengo his desperate charge at the head of the
heavy cavalry saved the day, and “set the crown of
France on Napoleon’s head.” But Napoleon found
it far safer and far cheaper to praise a dead man, and
he awarded the chief credit to the slain Desaix.
D’Hautpoult died at the head of his Cuirassiers at
Eylau, charging one army to save another. St.
Hilaire, the finest of them all, died miserably at
Essling, with the Empire reeling round him.
Lasalle, the pride of the light cavalry, the man who
captured Stettin with a few score Hussars, fell at
the head of his men in the pursuit after Wagram.
Montbrun, another Cuirassier, was killed in the
great redoubt at Borodino.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their names are carved upon the Arc de
Triomphe, and the bourgeois peer at them with
self-satisfaction. They fell in a far less worthy
cause than did the myriad Frenchmen who died by
poison gas and shrapnel in the trenches a few years
ago. To us now it seems to be nearly blasphemy
to think in the same moment of the Moskowa and
the Marne, or to speak in the same breath of the
sieges of Verdun and of Hamburg. The Englishman
turns lightly from the great names on the Arc
de Triomphe, and thinks with proud regret of the
simple inscription on an empty tomb in Whitehall.
And yet these men were the wonders of their time.
They did their duty; more cannot be said of any
man, and much less of most. They gave their
lives with a smile for a country which they adored.
Danger was as usual to them as was the air they
breathed. They gave their blood in streams; they
marched with their men into every Continental
capital. Their cowed enemies regarded them
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
timidly, as though they were beings from another
world. Their continued success and their overwhelming
victories might well have led them to
believe themselves superhuman. And when Waterloo
was fought and lost they went back to their
beloved France—such of them as survived—and
nursed their wounds on pensions of thirty pounds
a year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one general of division who attained
as near as might be to a marshalate without quite
achieving this last step. He was made a duke and
he gained a vast fortune. This man was Junot.
Junot, indeed, is often stated to have received his
bâton, but he never did, although he was as much
a favourite of Napoleon’s at one time as was
Marmont. It was Junot who at Toulon was writing
a letter at Bonaparte’s dictation, when a cannon shot
plunged near-by and scattered earth over them.
“We need no sand to dry the ink now,” laughed
Junot, and from that day his future was made. He
married Mademoiselle Laurette Permon, whom
Napoleon had once courted, and whose memoirs are
one of the most interesting books of the period.
Junot himself served as Bonaparte’s aide-de-camp all
over Europe and in Egypt as well. He received
promotion steadily, and was a general of division in
a very brief while. With that rank, however, he
was forced to be content, for Napoleon realized his
shortcomings, while a wound in the head which he
early received unbalanced him a little mentally.
The one outstanding feature of his character was his
passionate devotion to Napoleon. Napoleon was his
God, and Junot served him with a faithfulness almost
unexampled. Adventures came his way with a
frequency characteristic of the period. He fell into
English hands and was exchanged; he went as
ambassador to Portugal and made a large fortune;
he was appointed Governor of Paris, and withstood
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
Caroline Bonaparte’s blandishments when she tried
to induce him to subvert the Government. Half
dead with wounds, he travelled across Europe in
November, 1805, and arrived at Austerlitz on the very
morning of the battle. He was again wounded
heading a charge that day. In 1807 Napoleon gave
him a command which he hoped would bring him
fame, and a marshalate was promised in the event of
success. Junot was to lead the army of Portugal
from France to Lisbon; he was to capture the Portuguese
royal family and the English shipping in the
harbour; he was to tear down the Portuguese Government
and to rule the country himself in the name of
the Emperor. Junot set out with a mixed French
and Spanish force numbering nearly forty thousand
men. At every stage he received frantic orders from
Paris demanding greater speed from him and his men.
Junot did what he could. The whole valley of the
Tagus was littered with the guns, dead horses and
exhausted men whom he had left behind. His army
was dispersed into fragments, and it was only with
four hundred men at his back that Junot burst into
Lisbon. The English shipping and the Portuguese
royal family had fled the day before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Junot was in a serious position. With four
hundred men he had to rule a large town simmering
with rebellion, but he succeeded, and held the
country down while the rest of his army trailed disconsolately
into Lisbon. His astonishing march had
not achieved its object, and the marshal’s bâton was
therefore withheld. Napoleon offered some sort of
consolation by creating Junot Duke of Abrantès, but
there is no doubt that the disappointment weighed
heavily upon him. Napoleon had meditated making
Junot Duke of Nazareth, in memory of his victory
during the Syrian campaign, but he had decided that
it would be inadvisable, as the soldiers would call
him “Junot of Nazareth.”
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon was not quite so far-sighted when at
the same time he made Victor, at the suggestion of
one of the wits of his court, Duke of Belluno.
Victor was commonly called the Beau Soleil of the
French Army. Napoleon’s investiture made him
Duke of Belle Lune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately afterwards the Spanish war broke
out, and Junot found himself isolated at Lisbon. He
gathered his forces together, and without any help
whatever from France he maintained them and
re-equipped them at the cost of unfortunate Portugal.
But it was not to last long, for Wellington landed in
Mondego bay, and Junot, furiously attacking him,
was badly beaten at Vimiero. There followed the
Convention of Cintra. By it Junot and his men were
transported back to France with their arms, baggage
and plunder; all that the English gained was a bloodless
occupation of Portugal. It is difficult now to
decide who had the best of this agreement. Certainly
Napoleon thought that Junot had made a good
bargain, and equally certainly the English public
thought that Wellington had blundered badly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Convention had not been concluded, the
English would have cut Junot off from France (two
hundred thousand Spanish insurgents had done that
already) and would have shut him up in Lisbon.
Without a doubt, Junot would have made a desperate
resistance there. Masséna’s holding of Genoa in
1800 might have been re-enacted, and the wretched
Portuguese might have starved while Junot held out.
In this event the hands of the English would have
been so full that no help could have been offered to
the Spanish armies; Moore’s skilful thrust at Sahagun
could never have been made, and the Spaniards
might have met with utter annihilation. By the
Convention of Cintra, France gained an immediate
benefit, but England eventually gained even more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Vimiero, Junot’s military career is one of
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
continued failure—failure under Masséna in the
Busaco campaign, failure under Napoleon in the
Russian campaign, until at last the Duke of Abrantès
was sent into comparative exile as Governor of
Illyria. Here his troubles, his wounds and his disappointments
bore too heavily upon him. He went
raving mad, and performed all sorts of lunatic actions
in his Illyrian province until he was removed to
France. At Dijon he flung himself from a window
and killed himself. Junot is one more example of
those whom Napoleon favoured, who met with
horrible ends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Marshals and Generals alike, Napoleon’s
superior officers were nearly all distinguished by one
common failing—a dread of responsibility and a
hopeless irresolution when compelled to act on their
own initiative. The examples of this are almost too
numerous to mention; the most striking perhaps is
Berthier’s failure during the early period of the
campaign of 1809. There are many others which had
much more important results, although at first they
seem trivial in comparison. Thus, Dupont’s surrender
at Baylen, although it only involved twenty
thousand men, was one of the principal causes of the
prolongation of the Peninsular War. Dupont
surrendered with twenty thousand men; his action
necessitated the employment in the Peninsula of
three hundred thousand men for six years afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another incident of the same type was Vandamme’s
disaster at Kulm. Vandamme was a burly,
heavy-jawed soldier of the furious and thoughtless
kind, who had learnt his trade thoroughly well by
rule of thumb, and who had made his name a byword
throughout Germany on account of his dreadful
depredations. His boast was that he feared neither
God nor devil, and Napoleon referred to this once
when he said that Vandamme was the most valuable
of all his soldiers because he was the only one he
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
could employ in a war against the Infernal regions,
should such a contingency arise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In July, 1813, the Armistice of Pleisswitz had
come to an end, and Austria had joined the ranks of
Napoleon’s enemies. The Grand Army was in
Silesia when the news arrived that the Austrians were
marching on Dresden. Napoleon turned back without
hesitation, marched a hundred and twenty miles
in four days, and by what was almost his last victory
he saved the town. At the commencement of his
march he had detached Vandamme with twenty
thousand men to hold the passes of the Erz Gebirge
against the retreating forces. The beaten Austrian
army came reeling back towards them. The
Emperor of Austria and the Czar of Russia were
present in its ranks, and it seemed as if nothing could
save them from surrender. Fortunately, perhaps,
for Europe, Napoleon was unwell and did not press
the pursuit as closely as he might have done, and
Vandamme, who rushed into peril like a bull into
the ring, without outposts, without flank guards,
without any reasonable protection, was overwhelmed
by forces outnumbering his by four to one, and was
forced to surrender. Vandamme may have feared
neither God nor devil, but he had not the brains for
a command in chief, even against men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His own honour he redeemed from all possible
accusations of cowardice, when, a prisoner in Austrian
hands, with all the possibilities before him of condemnation
to slow death in a salt-mine or speedy
death on the spot, he was led before the Czar, and he
did not quail. Alexander rated him for his excesses in
Prussia, and Vandamme hit back at Alexander’s
tender spot—his conscience. “At least I did not
kill my own father,” said Vandamme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indecision characterizes the actions of many
French generals during the Empire. The most
discussed case perhaps was Grouchy’s hesitation at
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
Wavre during the Waterloo campaign, and this,
curiously enough, was not really hesitation. The
sole military crime of which Grouchy was guilty was
a too pedantic obedience to orders. Grouchy has
been blamed for misreading the situation and for not
marching from Wavre on Waterloo, but Napoleon
misread the situation just as badly, as his orders to
Grouchy clearly prove. Moreover, once Grouchy’s
hands had been freed by the destruction of the main
French army, his actions were exceedingly bold and
competent. His retreat across the Allies’ rear and
his capture of Namur were manœuvres of sound
military skill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grouchy’s military career had been in every way
honourable throughout his life. He had ridden
bravely to destruction at the head of his dragoons
during Murat’s charge at Eylau. He had fought
magnificently at Friedland and elsewhere. The
only other time when he had been in independent
command, and when he did display genuine dilatoriness
was many years before when he had found
himself in command owing to the loss of Hoche on
the French expedition to Bantry Bay in 1796.
Grouchy’s courage failed him then, and he withdrew
at the very time when his landing would have set
Ireland in an inextinguishable blaze. For a series
of quite strictly correct actions at Waterloo Grouchy
has gone down to history as a fool and a humbug,
but he was neither—to any great extent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the Waterloo campaign there was
certainly one example of a general being overwhelmed
by his sense of responsibility. Up to the moment
of execution not one of Napoleon’s plans of attack
had been more brilliantly conceived or better
arranged. A hundred and twenty thousand men
were assembled at the crossings of the Sambre by
Charleroi without the enemy gathering more than a
hint as to what was in the air; in fact the Allies’
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
Intelligence completely lost sight of Gérard’s corps
of sixteen thousand men. From this point, however,
the arrangements rapidly grew worse and worse.
Bad staff work caused delays at the crossing of the
Sambre; Ney’s unexpected appointment to the
command of the left wing was disturbing, in that
he was without a staff and his sudden elevation
annoyed d’Erlon and Reille, his subordinate corps
commanders. Zieten’s stubborn rearguard actions
held up the French columns for a considerable time;
and finally a sort of universal misunderstanding led
to everyone being more or less in the dark as to the
need for a determined and immediate attack. Ney,
goaded by repeated orders, at last attacked at Quatre
Bras quite six hours later than he should have done,
and even then he had only half his force in hand.
The other half, under d’Erlon, was making its way
towards him, when it was caught up by an aide-de-camp
of Napoleon’s, who was bearing a message to
Ney requesting him to send help to the Emperor at
Ligny. The aide-de-camp, on his own responsibility,
sent d’Erlon marching over towards Ligny instead
of to Quatre Bras, and went on to inform Ney of
his action. Ney was furious. Every moment the
British army in front of him was being reinforced,
and he was now being steadily pushed back. He
saw defeat close upon him, and he sent off a frantic
order to d’Erlon to retrace his steps and march on
Quatre Bras. The order reached d’Erlon at the
crisis of the battle of Ligny. For hours a fierce and
sanguinary battle had raged there, and at the crucial
moment d’Erlon had appeared, like a god from a
machine, with twenty thousand men on the Prussian
flank. Napoleon sent him urgent orders to attack,
but the officier d’ordonnance returned disconsolate.
D’Erlon had just received Ney’s order and had
marched back towards Quatre Bras, where he arrived
just as darkness fell, two hours too late. His sense
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
of responsibility did not permit him to disregard the
orders of his immediate superior, although it had lain
in his power, by disregarding them, to have dealt the
Prussian army a blow from which it could hardly
have recovered. The attack d’Erlon should have
made was later made by six thousand weary men who
had fought all day long, and naturally did not have
the immense success d’Erlon might have achieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drouet, Comte d’Erlon, had built himself up
during twenty campaigns a reputation as a skilful
and hard-fighting officer. He was neither a poltroon
nor congenitally weak-minded; what was the matter
with him was that he had fought twenty campaigns
under Napoleon. The brilliance of the Emperor and
the implicit, blind obedience he demanded had
weakened d’Erlon’s initiative past all reckoning. It
is interesting to compare d’Erlon’s action at Ligny
with Lannes’ at Friedland, or with the daring of the
subordinate Prussian officers at Mars-la-Tour and at
Gravelotte in 1870.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet one cannot help but think, on reading
military history, that the Lannes and the Davouts
of this world are astonishingly few when compared
with the d’Erlons and the Duponts. Military history
is a history of blunders, fortunate or unfortunate.
Men are found everywhere in control of the lives
and destinies of ten, twenty, a hundred thousand
men, and completely unable even to expend them in
an efficient manner. On reading of the fumbling
campaigns of Schwartzenberg, of Carlo Alberto, of
Napoleon III., or even of wars waged more recently
still, and of which we ourselves have had experience,
one cannot help feeling overwhelming pity at the
thought of the wretched men—every one of them as
full of life as you or I—who were called upon to lay
down everything at the call of duty or patriotism—and
to lay down everything <span class='it'>uselessly</span>. The argument
against war which appeals most to those who may
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
have to take part in it is not so much that it is
expensive or that it costs lives, but that it is so
blightingly inefficient. To die because one’s country
is in need, that is one thing; but to die because one’s
commanding officer has bad dreams, is quite another
matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the armies of Napoleon were at least free
from a horrible slur which has been cast upon other
armies. We cannot find anywhere any hint that the
officers did not do all their duty as far as they
visualized it. On going into action the men did not
shout “Les epaulettes en avant” as did the army
of the Second Empire at Solferino. No officer of
Napoleon’s ever wasted his men’s lives to gratify his
own pride, in the way that English marines died at
Trafalgar. It was said with pride of an officer of
Marlborough’s that he always said, “Come on” not
“Go on” to his men. The same could be said of
every one of the higher officers of the army of the
First Empire. The hundreds of volumes of memoirs
written by Napoleon’s men teem with examples
(grudgingly given, in some cases) of valour, but there
is hardly one case where an Imperial officer is accused
of cowardice, or even of shirking. The officers bore
exactly the same hardships as did the men, and the
friendship and trust which existed between the rank
and file and the commissioned officers of the army
of the First Empire has never been excelled in any
other army in history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A simple calculation at any Napoleonic battle will
show that the number of generals killed is proportionate
to that of the privates, while of the twenty-four
Marshals of the Empire who fought after the
inauguration, three—Lannes, Bessières and Poniatowski—were
killed in action, and all the others were
wounded at various times. Napoleon himself, as is
well known, was wounded during the fighting round
Ratisbon in 1809, and Duroc, his trusted Grand
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
Marshal of the Palace, was struck down at his side
by a stray cannon shot at Bautzen in 1813, and died
an hour later in horrible agony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The facts about the Imperial army are curiously
contradictory. The men were devoted to Napoleon,
but their devotion did not hold them together in
moments of panic. The officers were experienced
in all the details of war, but for all their experience
they lost touch with the Prussian army during the
vital period following Ligny. Napoleon had laid
down as essential various rules of strategy—but he
departed from them during the autumn campaign of
1813. Nothing seems consistent or satisfactory
during the whole period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet there are hundreds upon hundreds of
incidents of which one cannot read without a thrill.
Cambronne at Waterloo replying with a curse when
called upon to surrender in the face of certain
destruction; the Red Lancers of the Guard gaining
the Somo Sierra in the teeth of a tempest of cannon
shot; the conscripts of 1814, in sabots and blouses,
facing undaunted the savage enemy cavalry at
Champaubert; Ney rallying the rearguard during the
retreat from Moscow; Kellermann charging an army
at Quatre Bras; the engineers dying gladly to save
the army at the Beresina; all these incidents are
worthy to be remembered with pride, and almost blot
out the memory of the hideous ferocity of these selfsame
men in Spain, in Germany and in Russia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the fate of the Emperor and the Grand
Army to be equally at the mercy of the panegyrics
of the admirer and the insults of anyone who chooses
to inveigh against them.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>T would be as easy to omit all mention of
Napoleon’s mistresses in a serious history as it
would be difficult to omit the king’s mistresses
from a history of Louis le Grand or Louis le Bien-Aimé.
Napoleon was not the man to allow his policy
to be influenced by women. Not one of the many
with whom he came into contact could boast that
she had deflected him one hairbreadth from the path
he had mapped for himself. Not all Josephine’s
tears could save the life of the young d’Enghien;
not all Walewska’s pleading could re-establish the
kingdom of Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adultery,” said Napoleon, “is a sofa affair,”
and he was speaking for once in all honesty. He
was a man blessed with a vast personality, a vast
power and a vast income, and it is unusual for a man
with these three to go long a-suing. Moreover, if
the lady who attracted his attention proved recalcitrant,
Napoleon rarely pleaded; he raised his offer,
and in the event of a further refusal he turned
away without a sigh and forgot all about her. That
indicates Napoleon’s attitude towards women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were, as a matter of fact, one or two whom
he honoured by more lover-like attentions. Josephine
cost him many bitter hours of self-reproach;
Walewska he sought long and earnestly; he displayed
every sign of attachment towards Marie Louise.
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
Yet not merely these three, but every woman who
granted him favours received in return immense gifts,
and, if she desired it, a husband whose path to promotion
was made specially easy. The women who
flit into and then out of Napoleon’s life seem to
be without number, but the gossip of a thousand
memoirs, and the hints of a thousand letters, combined
with the painstaking care of a crowd of patient
inquirers, have brought them all under notice at some
time or other. And yet the most elaborate research
can only prove that there was one woman who might
perhaps have given much to Bonaparte before his
meeting with Josephine, and that was a street-walker
of the Palais Royal. This tiny incident is hinted at
in a letter written by Bonaparte at the age of
eighteen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this, we find nothing of the same nature
for another nine years. Napoleon was too busy and
too desperately poor to trouble about such things.
He flirted with Laurette Permon, who later became
Madame Junot, Duchess d’Abrantès; with his
sister-in-law, Désirée Clary, afterwards Madame
Bernadotte, Princess of Ponte Corvo and Queen of
Sweden and Norway; and with a few young women
of good social position whom he met while serving
as a junior officer of artillery at Valence. That is
all. He came to Josephine heartwhole and inexperienced,
and he lavished upon her during the first
feverish months of his married life all the stored-up
passion of a man of twenty-six. Josephine baulked
and thwarted this passion by her delay in joining him
while he was conquering Italy, by her petty flirtations
with Charles and others, and by the general light-mindedness
of her behaviour; from that time forth
Napoleon became passionless towards all women.
Some he liked, and some he even admired, as far as
it was in his nature to admire anyone, but for none
did he ever exhibit the uncontrollable desire which
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
for that brief space he had felt for Josephine.
Unfaithfulness to her, which he would once have
regarded as treason, he now thought of merely as
necessary to a man of mature age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, throughout the years 1796 and 1797
one cannot find any proof of genuine inconstancy.
It was only in 1798, when Napoleon found himself
the unrestrained ruler of Egypt, with the whole East
apparently at his feet, that he left the narrow path of
strict physical virtue. The native ladies did not
appeal to him, and he turned with disgust from their
over opulent charms. The same cannot be said of
some of his officers, a few of whom actually married
Egyptian beauties and later brought them back to
France. Menou, who succeeded to the chief command
after Napoleon’s departure and Kléber’s
assassination, was one of these. Others, again,
married and settled down in Egypt after the
evacuation. Their descendants were supporters of
Mehemet Ali, and even nowadays many rich
Egyptian proprietors can trace back their descent
to a Frankish ancestor who became a Mohammedan
a hundred and twenty years ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But although, as has been said, Napoleon found
no charms behind the yashmaks, the possibilities
were by no means exhausted, as his aides-de-camp
hastened to point out to him. A few Frenchwomen,
by donning male attire, had evaded the strict regulation
that no women should accompany the Army of
the Orient. The most attractive of these was
Marguerite Pauline, wife of a lieutenant of Chasseurs,
by name Fourès. To a Commander-in-Chief
all things are possible, and young Fourès was packed
off in one of the frigates which had escaped from the
disaster of the Nile with orders to carry despatches
to the Directory. The night of his departure
Madame Fourès (la Bellîlote, as she was called, from
her maiden name of Belleisle) was entertained by
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
Napoleon at a gay little dinner party; the proceedings,
however, were cut short by the General upsetting
iced water over her dress and carrying her off
under the pretext of having the damage attended to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this la Bellîlote was established in a Cairo
palace close to General Headquarters, and the little
idyll seemed to be progressing famously when a most
indignant intruder in the person of Lieutenant
Fourès appeared on the scene. He had been
captured by the English on his way to Italy, and
had been returned for the express purpose of inconveniencing
the Général-en-chef. The English were,
however, doomed to disappointment, for Napoleon,
exercising his dictatorial powers, had a divorce pronounced
between Fourès and his wife, and then sent
the wretched man back once more to France. From
this time forth la Bellîlote had an almost regal
dominion in Cairo. The finest silks in the land were
confiscated for her adornment, and she drove about
the streets amid cries from the soldiers of “Vive
la Générale!” and “Vive Clioupatre!” At times
she even appeared on horseback in a general’s
uniform and cocked hat. The whole proceeding
savours of some of the doings of the early Roman
Emperors. Suetonius tells us very similar stories
of Nero and Caligula. Little adverse comment
was caused among the French; it was a very usual
thing during the Revolutionary era for officers to be
accompanied by women in this fashion. Some
women even served generals as aides-de-camp and
orderlies, while the Army of Portugal during 1810-11
was frequently hindered because Masséna, commanding,
had his <span class='it'>chère amie</span> with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Fourès’ experience of the delights of
being the left-handed queen of the uncrowned king
of an unacknowledged kingdom was not destined to
endure long; Napoleon returned to France, and she,
following him, by his orders, as soon as possible,
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
fell into the hands of the English just as her husband
had done. When at last she reached France Bonaparte
refused to see her, for he was now reconciled
to Josephine, besides being First Consul and having
to be careful of his moral reputation. Napoleon did
whatever else he could for her; he gave her large sums
of money, bought her houses, and secured a new
husband for her, whose agreement he ensured by
means of valuable appointments under the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon and la Bellîlote never met again; after
1815 she eloped with another man, built up a substantial
fortune in the South American trade, and
finally died quite in the odour of sanctity at the
venerable age of ninety-one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Bonaparte’s return to France Josephine had
contrived to win him once more to her, despite the
efforts of his family, and his own half-determination
to end the business there and then, but matters were
never the same between them. Napoleon indulged
more and more frequently in petty amours with
various women, and Josephine, instead of appreciating
her helplessness, as is the more usual way
with queens and empresses, caused frequent furious
scenes by spying on his actions and upbraiding him
when any rumour came to her notice. Napoleon
cared no whit; he was, moreover, able, by virtue of
his supreme power, frequently to ensure that Josephine
knew nothing of his infidelity. In 1800 he
was peculiarly successful in this way. Marengo had
been fought and won, and the First Consul was
enjoying, at Milan, the fruits of his dramatic success.
The most eminent contralto of the time, Grassini,
sang at concerts hurriedly arranged in his honour.
Grassini had endeavoured to force herself on his
notice three years before, without success, for
Josephine held power over him then. The circumstances
were different now, and Napoleon, his
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
Italian temperament inexpressibly charmed by her
magnificent voice, honoured her by a summons to
his apartments. She obeyed gladly; she came at his
request to Paris; and finally Napoleon had the
effrontery to command her to sing at the thanksgiving
festival in the Invalides for the Marengo
campaign, where he appeared accompanied by his
wife and by all the notabilities of the Consulate.
Later she appeared at the Théâtre de la République,
and was given a large allowance, both publicly as a
singer and secretly as a friend of Napoleon’s. The
arrangement ended abruptly, for Grassini was
detected in an intrigue with an Italian musician, and
left France for a Continental tour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not till 1807 that she returned, and
although Napoleon never renewed the old relationship,
he gave her an official title, a large salary and
employment under his Bureau of Music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grassini spent the rest of her days mainly in
Paris, and she enjoyed a vast reputation all her life.
Money troubles, due to her passion for gambling, and
wild adventures of the heart, engaged most of her
attention. It has even been said that after Waterloo
she condescended to grant Wellington the same
favours as Napoleon had enjoyed thirteen years
before. Despite the obvious bias of many of the
witnesses, the evidence to this end seems conclusive.
If it really was true, then Grassini might claim a
distinction as notable as Alava’s, who was the only
man who fought both at Trafalgar and at Waterloo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Grassini passed out of Napoleon’s life, a
long period ensued during which no woman received
the Emperor’s favour for any continuous length of
time. At intervals various hooded figures slipped
through the postern door of the Tuileries, past
Roustam the Mameluke, and through a secret
passage to the Imperial apartments, but the visits
were irregular and were merely the results of passing
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
whims on the part of the Emperor. Not one of the
women concerned had need of much pressure to
become agreeable to the invitations brought them by
Duroc, the faithful Grand Marshal of the Palace.
They were actresses mainly, and since most of them
appeared at theatres managed or subsidized by the
Government, Napoleon, if not their direct employer,
had in his gift important acting parts and desirable
salaries. Many of them were already the mistresses
of dandies of the town, and some of them passed on
to act in the same capacity for various crowned heads
of Europe, while one was actually requested by a
powerful party in Russia to win Alexander the Czar
from an objectionable <span class='it'>chère amie</span> so that he might
return to the Czarina!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon did all he could to keep these liaisons
secret, but he was rarely successful. The women
boasted far and wide of their success, and it is likely
that many of those who boasted had nothing to boast
about. Some even went so far as to publish their
memoirs after the Restoration, and to make capital
of their own dishonour. Another factor which
militated against secrecy was Josephine’s jealousy.
Josephine, with the spectre of divorce always before
her eyes, was in continual terror lest Napoleon should
experience a lasting attachment for one of his stray
lights o’ love. Consequently she spied upon him
incessantly, battered on his locked doors, wrote
frantic appeals to her friends for help and information,
and generally acted with less than her usual
dignity. Napoleon disregarded her appeals, and
stormed back at her whenever she ventured to
remonstrate. He was above all law, he declared, and
he would allow no human being to judge his actions.
Nevertheless, he took care to interfere with the most
intimate affairs of all his friends. He tried to bully
Berthier, his trusted Chief of Staff, into separating
from the lady with whom he had lived for years. At
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
first it seemed as if he was successful, and he consoled
his friend by giving him as wife a Princess of
the royal House of Bavaria. However, Berthier
contrived to obtain his young bride’s agreement to
the presence of the other lady, and the three of them
ran a perfectly happy <span class='it'>ménage à trois</span> for the rest
of his life. Napoleon meddled with many other
people’s domestic affairs, and it is darkly hinted that
Talleyrand’s enmity for the Emperor began when
Napoleon first disturbed the tranquillity which existed
between the great diplomat and Madame Grand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Emperor continued serenely on his way,
acting up to his dictum that women were merely
incidents in a man’s life. His Court was thronged
with greedily ambitious women who threw themselves
in his path at every opportunity. At the least
hint of a preference on his part, officious courtiers
hurried to assist in the negotiations in the hope either
of favour or perquisites. The astonishing thing is
that the list of the chosen is not many times longer.
These intrigues all ran much the same course—a brief
partnership, generally without a hint of affection on
either side; a minor place in Court for the lady; then
a marriage was arranged, an ample dowry provided
by the Emperor, and the incident was closed. Not
merely did people endeavour to gain their private
ends in this manner, but even political parties made
use of similar tools. During the Consulate the
Bourbons despatched a lady to Paris for the sole
purpose of ensnaring Bonaparte, and it is hinted that
Metternich endeavoured to place a friend at Court
in the same fashion. The great example of this
political manœuvre, however, occurs later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before Madame Walewska’s name, even,
was known to Napoleon, he formed an attachment
of some slight historical importance. Eléonore
Denuelle was an exceedingly beautiful girl, daughter
of parents of a doubtful mode of life, who had been
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
educated at Madame Campan’s famous school along
with Caroline Bonaparte and various other great
ladies of the Court. Her parents designed a great
marriage for her, but they met with poor success,
for a certain graceless ex-officer, by name Revel,
succeeded in making her believe that he was a
good match, and the couple were married early in
1805. Revel believed that Eléonore was an heiress;
Eléonore believed that Revel was a rich man; they
were both of them woefully disappointed, and
separated after two months of married life. Eléonore
in despair applied for help to Caroline Murat, and
received a minor post in that princess’s household.
Napoleon noticed her in January, 1806, and from
that time the affair moved rapidly, for in February
Eléonore applied for a divorce from Revel (who was
now in gaol), and in December a son was born to
her whose father, almost without a doubt, was
Napoleon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time of his birth, however, Napoleon had
formed a new attachment, and Eléonore was never
again admitted to his rooms. Napoleon saw that
both his son and his ex-mistress were suitably provided
for; he settled a thousand pounds a year on
Eléonore and married her to a prominent politician
(a Monsieur Augier), while he invested large sums
of money in trust for her son, Léon. He further
mentioned him in his will. Eléonore’s later career
was unlucky; her second husband died, a prisoner in
Russian hands, and when she married for a third
time she was blackmailed for the rest of her life by
her first husband and by her scapegrace illegitimate
son. Léon ruined all his chances of success in life
by his reckless way of living. He gambled away all
he possessed, and then lived on what small sums he
could beg from his mother and from his Bonaparte
relations. He plunged into politics, and even considered
for a while standing as a candidate for the
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
position of President of the Second Republic in
opposition to Louis Napoleon. He induced the
latter to give him a small pension; he made all
manner of claims upon the Government, and
squandered whatever he obtained in a wild fashion.
He issued all sorts of remarkable suggestions, not
one of them of the slightest value, on every conceivable
subject, and he raised the most frightful clamour
when they were disregarded. There is no doubt
that he was mentally deranged. He died in 1881
without having accomplished a single noteworthy
action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a faint doubt as to Léon’s paternity, due
to his mother’s way of living, but the doubts are
countered by his striking physical resemblance to the
Emperor. Napoleon himself certainly believed him
to be his own child; perhaps if he could have foreseen
the later career of the child in question he would have
been more chary of his acknowledgment. The
whole affair seems to be very much wrapped in doubt;
Napoleon evinced for young Léon not half the care
which he displayed for his other sons, while Léon’s
birth (perhaps because it took place while Napoleon
was away in Poland) did not rouse nearly as much
interest as Walewski’s three years later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has already been said that at the time of Léon’s
birth Napoleon’s attention was occupied by a new
mistress; it was this particular mistress who has been
elevated by some writers to the proud position of
being “the only woman Napoleon ever loved,” and
who certainly held whatever affection the Emperor
was able to display for a longer period than any other
woman. To begin with, she was of a rank and class
far different from any of her predecessors, Josephine
not excepted, while secondly she was far fonder of
him than was any other woman. The circumstances
in which the two met were romantic. Napoleon had
just overturned the Prussian monarchy; he had
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
advanced like lightning from the Rhine to the
Niemen, and he burst at the head of the Grand Army
into Poland, where never before had a French army
appeared. The Poles were in ecstasy. They had
not the least doubt that their period of slavery was
ended, and that the young conqueror would once
more unchain the White Eagle. Deputations
thronged to meet him, and mobs gave him homage
in the villages. At the little town of Bronia, not
far from Warsaw, a lady was presented to him at
her earnest request, for she had braved all the terrors
of the hysterical mob in order to meet him. She
proved to be hardly more than a child, and dazzlingly
beautiful. Napoleon thanked her for her kindness,
and said that he was anxious to see her again. The
whole interview barely lasted a minute, for it was
imperative that Napoleon should press on to Warsaw,
but it made a deep impression on both of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marie Laczinska was the daughter of one of the
old noble families of Poland, and she had recently
married Anastase Colonna de Walewice-Walewska.
Although Marie’s family was noble, it was hardly
to be compared with that of her husband, for
Anastase was not only the head of a house in whose
veins ran the bluest blood of Poland, but he also
traced his descent to the Roman family of Colonna,
and through them his line ran back into the mists
of history beyond the Carolings and the Merovings
until one could trace its source among the patrician
families of republican Rome. He was rich, he was
famous, he held vast power. The only objections
to him as a husband were that he was seventy years
old and already had grandchildren who were older
than Marie. In the minds of Marie’s guardians
such objections were trivial, and the young girl was
forced into marriage with the old noble, to play
the part of Abishag to Walewska’s David. She
was not fated to endure this for long, because
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
Napoleon had not forgotten the meeting at Bronia,
and sought her at all the fêtes at which he appeared
in Warsaw. The secret could not be kept, and
soon all Poland was aware that the great Emperor
was in love with the Polish lady. The nationalist
party heard the news with wild exultation, and
Poniatowski, the hope of Poland, called upon her
to sacrifice herself for her country. The other great
nobles pressed her feverishly, and they contrived to
persuade Walewska (who, naturally, was the only
man who was ignorant of what was going on) to
bring his wife to a ball which Poniatowski was giving
in the Emperor’s honour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marie came reluctantly. She was dressed as
plainly as possible, in white satin without jewels,
and, once in the ballroom, she kept herself as far in
the background as she could. To no purpose,
however. Napoleon, overjoyed, observed her as
soon as she appeared, and immediately sent to her
and requested her to dance with him. She refused.
Duroc and Poniatowski remonstrated with her, but
she remained adamant. Many other French officers
had already noticed her dazzling beauty, her rich fair
hair and the blueness of her eyes, and they swarmed
round her. Napoleon watched the proceedings
jealously from the other end of the room. As soon
as any one of his officers appeared to have made any
progress, he called to his Chief of Staff, and that
particular officer was sent off post haste to carry a
message somewhere out in the bleak countryside a
hundred miles away. The situation verged on the
impossible. Napoleon in desperation made a tour of
the room, speaking to all the hundreds of women
present merely in order to exchange half a dozen
words with the one who was the cause of all this
trouble. When at last he reached Madame
Walewska the interview was unsatisfactory. She
was as pale as death, and said nothing. He was
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
vastly and unusually embarrassed. “White upon
white is a mistake, Madame,” he said, looking at
her pale cheeks. Then—“This is not the sort of
reception I expected after——” Then he passed on,
and left the ballroom soon after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That same evening she received a wild, urgent
note from Napoleon. Others followed in rapid
succession. Poniatowski and all the fiery patriots of
Poland implored her to yield. Her blind husband,
infatuated by this remarkable new popularity, bore
her to reception after reception. A mercenary old
aunt of hers, tampered with by Poniatowski, flung
herself into the business as well, and offered herself
as go-between. At last she received a letter from
Napoleon hinting that he would restore Poland if
she would yield. She yielded. Napoleon did not
restore Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Poland’s sake she had broken her marriage
vows and violated all the dictates of her conscience.
Napoleon, in return, temporized and compromised.
He erected the Grand Duchy of Warsaw out of
territory torn from Prussia, but the Grand Duchy
was not autonomous, it was not called Poland, it was
only one-third the size of the old land of the White
Eagle. Poor Marie protested to the best of her
ability, to be soothed by fair words from the
Emperor. At Napoleon’s request she left Poland
after Tilsit, and came to Paris, where she lived in
extreme retirement, visited by Napoleon as often as
he could manage. Her gentleness and dislike of
display must have been grateful to Napoleon after
his other experiences, and he passed many happy
hours with her. She was by his side during the
maelstrom of the Essling campaign, and at Schönbrunn,
the Palace of the Cæsars, she told him she
was about to bear him a child. She did not realize
then that from that selfsame palace Napoleon would
summon, in a few months’ time, a young girl who
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
would supplant her in his affections, and who would
also bear him a son, who, in place of being a nameless
bastard, would bear the title of King of Rome. She
went back to her dear Poland for the event, and at
Walewice, in May, 1810, Alexander-Florian-Joseph-Colonna-Walewski
was born. On her return to
Paris Napoleon had married Marie Louise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon softened the blow for her as well as he
could. He heaped wealth upon her; he gave her
town houses and country houses; the Imperial
officials were always at her orders, and the Imperial
theatres were always open to her. Her son, young
Walewski, was made a Count of the Empire.
Perhaps this was some consolation to her. Perhaps—seeing
that it was her son’s birth which had determined
Napoleon to make a new marriage—not.
Napoleon even found time during the turmoil of
the Campaign of France to make additional arrangements
in their favour, but by this time whatever
remained of the affair had long since burnt itself
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the fall of the Empire, Marie Walewska
seems to have considered herself free. She paid a
mysterious visit to Napoleon at Elba in 1814,
accompanied by her little son, and she was present
at the Tuileries on Napoleon’s arrival there during
the Hundred Days, but apparently on neither
occasion was the old relationship renewed. In
1816 she married a distant cousin of the Bonapartes,
a certain d’Ornano, a Colonel of the Guard, but she
was not destined long to enjoy her new happiness.
Marie de Walewska died in December, 1817.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Marie! Her life was short, but it must
have been full of bitterness. Napoleon’s affairs of
the heart (if they are even worthy of that name)
all seem inexpressibly harsh and matter-of-fact.
He seemed to have a kind of Midas touch in
these matters, whereby everything honourable and
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
romantic with which he came into contact turned,
not into gold, but into lead. Various authors have
tried to infuse into his association with Marie de
Walewska some gleam of romance, some essence of
the self-sacrificing spirit which is noticeable in the
parallel deeds of other monarchs, but they have
failed. Marie certainly seems at first to have believed
him to be a hero, a knight without reproach as well
as without fear, but as soon as she was disillusioned
she resigned herself to an existence as drab as if she
had been once more a septuagenarian’s wife, and not
the mistress of an Emperor. Contemporary Parisian
society was almost entirely ignorant of her existence.
She paid no calls, and she received none. The few
appearances she made at Court were such as were
only to be expected from a Polish lady of high rank.
Napoleon could not keep her love for long, and,
though she was faithful to him as long as the Empire
endured, she obviously considered herself free as
soon as Napoleon was sent to St. Helena. It was
not the long-drawn, heroic romance some writers
have endeavoured to make it appear; rather was it
a brief burst of passion, and then—monotony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baby Count of the Empire whom she left
behind enjoyed a distinguished career. In appearance
he certainly resembled his great father, but his
talents never seem to have risen above a mediocre
standard. Alexander-Florian-Joseph-Colonna-Walewski
was mainly educated in France, but he
was a Pole by birth, and he fought for Poland at the
age of twenty during the rising of 1830-31. When
Poland fell once more before the might of Russia,
he returned to France, became a Frenchman, and
served in the French army. The revolution of 1848
brought Napoleon III. to the front, and the new
Emperor, with his power based on the frail fabric of
a legend, saw fit to surround himself with names
which recalled to men’s minds the old splendours of
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
the First Empire. Walewski received honours in
plenty; he was Ambassador to the most important
Courts of Europe, a Senator, and a Minister of State.
He wrote learnedly on various subjects. But all his
glory was only a pale reflection of his father’s and
cousin’s; he suffered eclipse after Sedan, and when
he died, aged seventy-two, he had, after all, made
very little mark in the world. He had not played
the part of a Don John of Austria, or even of a
Monmouth. De Morny quite outshone him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Napoleon’s marriage to Marie Louise and
association with Madame Walewska, his casual
amorous adventures came to a more or less abrupt
end. It has been suggested that this was on account
of increasing age, but Napoleon was only in the early
forties, and this cannot be the true reason. However,
the explanation is just as simple. Napoleon
was devoted to his new wife, and he was frightfully
busy. From the summer of 1812, two years after
his second marriage, he was almost continuously in
the field. His exertions and worries thenceforward
were sufficient to occupy even him, without any
other complications. One likes to think of him
turning with relief from the agonizing strain of
ruling Europe to snatch a few quiet minutes in the
placid peace surrounding Marie Louise and her child.
That is all. He had no other mistress. At Elba he
lived with his sister and mother, with no woman to
share his inner life. Perhaps this was policy, for
Napoleon was trying hard to induce Marie Louise to
join him, and he would naturally be chary of doing
anything which might annoy her—ignorant as he
was of her unfaithfulness. This may be the explanation
of the briefness of Madame Walewska’s visit;
she may have come intending to join him, and he
may have sent her away again, but the fact that she
was accompanied by her brother and other relations
militates against this theory. Moreover, Marie was
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
already close friends with d’Ornano. After the
Hundred Days Napoleon was sent to St. Helena,
and once again no woman accompanied him. The
manifold rumours about Madame de Montholon and
others at St. Helena seem to have no foundation
whatever in fact. Thus practically all Napoleon’s
illicit loves are confined to the decade 1800-10, while
the last decade is entirely clear of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus far we have only treated of women who
were Napoleon’s mistresses; but considerable interest
also attaches to a large number of women who,
although members of the Imperial circle, never
attained this dubious honour. Perhaps of these the
one who attained the greatest heights (and who,
incidentally, did least to deserve it) was Désirée
Clary. She was the sister of the lady whom Joseph
Bonaparte made his wife, and whose dowry of six
thousand pounds was so welcome to the struggling
family. Désirée’s own dowry would have been of
the same amount, and Joseph and various other
Bonapartes tried to induce Napoleon to marry her.
He seems to have dallied with the idea; indeed, it is
frequently stated that a contract of betrothal was
drawn up, but, however it was, Napoleon broke off
the negotiations rather abruptly when he went to
Paris in 1795. There is hardly any doubt that he
had flirted with Désirée rather excessively, and
that, after making a deep impression upon her, he
had wounded her deeply by his precipitate abandonment.
Subsequently he tried to make amends in
much the same manner as he employed with his
discarded mistresses—he tried to find her a husband
to whom he could give substantial promotion.
But Désirée was once more unlucky, for the
man Napoleon sent to her, General Duphot,
was murdered almost on her threshold while she
was staying at Joseph Bonaparte’s Embassy in
Rome.
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Eventually she was approached by Bernadotte,
during Napoleon’s absence in Egypt, and married
him. Subsequently she declared that she had done
this because Bernadotte was the only man who could
injure Bonaparte, but she must have been far-sighted
indeed if she could perceive the career which
was awaiting Bernadotte. Moreau, and half a dozen
other generals, such as Augereau, were more powerful
than Bernadotte at the time. Désirée’s statement
was probably made in the light of subsequent
events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Bernadotte who gained most by the
marriage. He acquired at one stroke a venomous,
if inert, ally in his wife, an enthusiastic supporter
in Joseph, his brother-in-law, and a sure refuge in
case of trouble in Napoleon’s dislike of a scandal
in his family. From this time on, Désirée received
distinction after distinction, and soon she was Son
Altesse Serène la Maréchale Princesse de Ponte
Corvo, sister of the Queen of Spain, and a leading
figure in Imperial society. Then came the greatest
distinction of all, and she found herself Princess
Royal of Sweden. This last she found rather upsetting,
for she discovered she was expected to leave
her beloved Paris to live in the bleakness of the Stockholm
palaces. She said, tearfully and truthfully,
that she had thought at first that her new rank was
merely a titular distinction, of the same class as her
sovereignty of Ponte Corvo. She refused absolutely
to leave France, and so Bernadotte went alone to
Stockholm, thence to lead his Swedes against the
Empire, while his wife stayed on in Paris. It
certainly was an anomalous position, and some
authors have said that Désirée acted as a spy on
behalf of the Allies during the war of liberation.
However, we can be quite sure that Napoleon,
whatever tenderness he still felt towards her, would
not have tolerated her sending news of any value to
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
her husband; incidentally, it is obvious that a woman
to whose mind Ponte Corvo, with its six thousand
inhabitants, was in the same class as Sweden, with
its millions, could not have been of much use as
a spy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After 1815, fate overtook her, and she was borne
away to spend the rest of her life in the spartan
splendour of the palace in the Staden. From that
time forth she and her husband were a disappointed
couple, distrusted and despised by all Europe, he
with his eyes turned lingeringly towards the France
whose crown he believed he had so nearly attained,
she thinking longingly of the gaiety and careless
freedom of the Paris she had left behind, which now
hated her with true Parisian virulence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon’s sisters married before the plenitude of
his power, and the matches they made were not as
splendid as they might have been later; it was for
his younger but much more distant connections that
Napoleon was able to find husbands of royal rank.
It is curious to notice the extraordinary marriages
which were arranged while the Empire was at its
height. A niece of Murat’s, who had been brought
up as the ragged and bare-footed daughter of a small
farmer, married Prince Charles of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen,
and among her grandchildren and
great-grandchildren at the present day are the King
of Rumania, the King of the Belgians and the
Queen of Portugal. Several of the petty princelings
of Germany, with thirty generations of royal
descent behind them, married obscure little Beauharnais
and Taschers de la Pagerie. Eugène de
Beauharnais and Berthier married princesses of
Bavaria, and Jerome received as bride a daughter
of the King of Würtemberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eugène’s marriage had caused a difficult situation,
for Augusta of Bavaria was already affianced
to the Hereditary Prince of Baden, heir apparent to
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
the reigning Grand Duke. Napoleon had caused
the marriage contract to be broken, but he was in
no way disconcerted; he straightway found a new
bride for the Hereditary Prince. He selected
Stéphanie de Beauharnais, a “thirty-second cousin”
of Josephine’s. Stéphanie was the merest child,
who had had the most extraordinary upbringing.
Her parents were of a shiftless character, like
various other Beauharnais, and after the Revolution
Stéphanie had been dependent on an English
peeress, Lady de Bathe, who had arranged with two
nuns from the suppressed houses to look after her.
As soon as Napoleon heard of her existence, he
summoned her to Court, and in accordance with his
pronounced ideas on family loyalty, made himself
responsible for her support. Next he announced
to her that he had secured her a royal husband.
Stéphanie immediately became a person of consequence,
because as yet royal marriages were by no
means common in the Bonaparte family. Their
Imperial Highnesses, Napoleon’s sisters, naturally
turned like tigresses upon the interloper, and reduced
the fifteen-year-old child to tears more than once in
the presence of the Court. This was more than
Napoleon could stand, and by a single decree he
gave the girl precedence over the whole Imperial
family save himself and Josephine. He wished to
keep the House of Baden as satisfied as possible.
With the same idea he gave Stéphanie a marvellous
trousseau, a dowry of sixty thousand pounds, and
jewels costing the same amount. Her wretched
father, who had returned from exile, received an
income of three thousand pounds a year and a lump
sum of two hundred thousand francs. He had done
nothing to earn it; he was merely the father of the
girl who was marrying an ally of the Emperor’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The period was one of general rejoicing, for
Austerlitz had just been won, and French domination
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
over Europe seemed assured. The fêtes of the
marriage were of unexampled splendour; there were
illuminations; there were fireworks; and there were
balls without number, at one of which over two
thousand persons appeared. But behind all the
rejoicings there was a curious tragi-comedy being
played, for poor Stéphanie, married at sixteen to a
man she had never met, displayed a disconcerting
reluctance to complete all the accompanying formalities.
Night after night she insisted on a girl
friend sharing her room with her. The Hereditary
Prince grew restive; the whole Court knew of the
deadlock, and were proportionately amused. But
international politics cannot wait on a girl’s whim;
war clouds were appearing again across the Rhine;
Prussia seemed bent on war, and it was important
for Napoleon to be sure of Baden’s friendship.
Napoleon admonished Stéphanie with all the severity
of which he was capable; he terrified the wretched
girl into passivity, and when at last the newly-married
couple set off for Carlsruhe Baden’s support of
France was assured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the unhappiness which awaited all Napoleon’s
favourites dogged poor Stéphanie to her grave. The
House of Zaehringen hated her as an intruder; her
male children all died in infancy, and when in 1818
her husband died she found herself without any
established position in a hostile land. Hints have
not been lacking that Charles of Baden died through
poison administered by the Hochberg family (of
morganatic descent from an earlier Elector), which
ultimately obtained the throne. But the strangest
story is that concerning Kaspar Hauser. In 1828 a
young man was found wandering in the streets of
Nuremberg, who had never seen the sunlight, and
whose whole appearance seemed to indicate that he
had been shut up in a cellar all his life. He did not
long survive his freedom. Stéphanie jumped to the
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
conclusion that he was her second son, born in 1811,
who was supposed to have died as an infant while
she was seriously ill. Many people have agreed with
her, and have supposed that he had been kidnapped
by the Hochbergs to prevent his inheritance of the
throne. Some people go further, and boldly declare
that after his escape he was poisoned. The whole
matter has an aura of peculiarity, and it has attracted
the attention of many writers of authority, among
them Mr. Baring Gould. The most obvious counter
to the theory that Kaspar Hauser was a son of
Stéphanie is that the people who would be bold
enough to kidnap him would have had the sense to kill
him outright, and not to keep him as living evidence
of their guilt. If they murdered him in 1828, they
would certainly not have flinched from murdering
him in 1811.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Stéphanie always believed that Kaspar was
her son, and she passed the last thirty years of her
life in mourning a murdered husband, a murdered
son, a lost throne, and the utter ruin of her whole
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is only one more example of the blight
which Napoleon left upon the lives of nearly everyone
with whom he came into close contact. All the
people who were indebted to him for their entire
personal advancement lived to see the day when they
paid for a few golden hours with the most utter
regret and bitterness. The only ones who “lived
happily ever after” were those who had always
regarded him with suspicion, like Macdonald, or
those of inferior mental calibre, like Marie Louise,
whom a strange Providence seemed to take under its
own special care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much for Napoleon’s relations with women.
Nowhere can one find the least trace of romance or
self-sacrifice on his part, and it can safely be said that
no woman ever loved him devotedly. Never could
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
Napoleon have said of any woman’s beauty, as
Richard III. said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>In men he could inspire the utmost self-devotion;
it seems hateful to think first of the Cuirassiers, a

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>P</span>ERHAPS now we can see a little more clearly the
man who was the centre of so much interest.
To appreciate a man’s character it is not so
much necessary to realize what he did, as to realize
what he wanted to do, what he was fond of doing,
and what he would have done had he been able; and
on the other hand it is equally necessary to realize
what it was he did not like doing. With Napoleon
these matters do not bear a great deal of analysis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One is astonished at first when it is borne in upon
one that Napoleon was a man of tepid desires in
most directions. It seems almost inconceivable that
the man who was the storm centre of Europe, who
was capable of rousing overwhelming emotion in
others, was nearly incapable of emotion himself.
Yet so it was. Napoleon had one ruling desire—for
work, and he had one ruling passion—for the army.
His secondary passions were small, and his dislikes
were equally small. Compared in this light to any
full-blooded personality, Dr. Johnson, for instance,
Napoleon fades away into dismal uninterestingness.
Work was what Napoleon liked best of all in this
world. When other men would have broken down
under the simultaneous strain of work and anxiety,
he throve and grew fat. One of his most famous
letters was written on this very subject to his
brother Joseph at the height of the Eylau campaign.
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
Joseph, from among the soft delights of Naples, had
written complaining of the troubles which beset him
while ruling his little kingdom, and Napoleon wrote
back briefly and sternly, telling how he was at that
moment engaged in a life and death struggle against
Bennigsen; how he was encumbered with the difficulties
of feeding and manœuvring two hundred
thousand men in the boggy plains of Poland, where
even he himself could hardly obtain the necessaries
of life; how at the same time the affairs of half
Europe demanded his attention, and yet for all this
he did not allow himself to be worried by these
numerous interests; he did all he had to do and
delighted in the strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It can safely be said that Napoleon never took a
holiday. Sometimes it has been hinted that in 1810
and 1811, after his marriage with Marie Louise, he
slackened his pace and did not do as much as he
might have done. This is true in part, but it is
equally true that during that time he got through an
amount of work which would have broken down most
men. Napoleon was not made for holidays. It is
hard to find, during the whole period covered by his
correspondence, a single day in which he did not
despatch a dozen letters, all of them bearing the hallmarks
of the utmost care and thought, and nearly
all of them vitally important links in a chain of
important decisions. Inactivity was hateful to him.
No sooner had he landed in Elba, removed entirely
from the usual outlets of his energy, than he flung
himself into the business of building up new interests.
He laboured harder while governing his little island
than did Kings of countries hundreds of times its
size. Only when he was lodged in St. Helena, do
we find a cessation of his frantic toil. Here circumstances
were against him; his gaolers did their best
in a blind fashion to prevent him from indulging in
either mental or physical activity, while the climate
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
and environments were both conducive to torpor.
Yet even at St. Helena Napoleon was responsible for
the production of a mass of written material of whose
amount an average man might be proud if it were
the results of the labour of a lifetime. Hard,
unrelenting toil was to Napoleon the breath of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chief relaxation was also in the nature of toil.
Napoleon was passionately fond of all things military.
Reviews were to him a source of unending delight.
On emerging triumphant from a period of intense
anxiety his first action almost invariably was to hold
a review of all the troops he could muster; the very
day on which he took up his residence at the Tuileries
after the <span class='it'>coup d’état</span> of Brumaire, he reviewed on the
Caroussel those battalions which later formed the
nucleus of the Guard, while at Tilsit he contrived
to arrange for two or three reviews every day. All
the pageantry and pomp of war appealed irresistibly
to this man to whom so little else appealed. To
Napoleon a battalion marching past in column of
double companies was worth all the vigour of Schiller
and all the passion of Alfieri. Soldiers are a delight
to most of us from our nursery days to our maturity;
the sight of a long line of bayonets or the brilliance
and glitter of the plumes and armour of the Household
Cavalry can still make us catch our breath for an
instant, but in few instances does this passion become
overwhelming. When it becomes characteristic of a
nation it usually portends calamity. Frederick
William I. of Prussia suffered from it to an extent
which has become historic, but in his case his passion
for soldiers was so overwhelming that he did not risk
losing any of his Potsdam Guards. Napoleon was
different; he intended his army for fighting, and
fight it did for twenty years, pomp and pageantry
notwithstanding. Not the wildest calumniator has
ever hinted that the reason why Napoleon did not
send the Guard into action at Borodino was because
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
he wanted to keep them to review in peace-time—though
this explanation is sounder than some of those
put forward. Napoleon indulged his passion whenever
possible, but he kept it nevertheless strictly
within bounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon had been a soldier from the age of
twelve, so that one can easily explain his liking for
military detail; he had been human from the day of
his birth, but it is not so easy to find any other human
traits or weaknesses. The pleasures of the table
meant nothing to him; twenty minutes sufficed for
dinner at the Tuileries, and he dined just as contentedly
on horse-steak in Russia as he did on the
elaborate dishes which delighted Marie Louise. So
far as can be ascertained Napoleon was never seen
drunk, or sea-sick, or dyspeptic. It would be almost
with relief that we would read of his suffering from
measles, had he ever done so. His freedom from
ordinary weaknesses tends to throw the whole picture
out of perspective. One can hardly be surprised that
even so sensible a man as Thiers lost his head while
telling of Napoleon’s exploits. There is only one
human touch to which we can turn to gain the
measure of the whole. Napoleon loved a lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have already described how ardently Napoleon
looked forward to his meeting with his Imperial
bride, and the complacency with which he referred to
her royal uncle and aunt his predecessors, Louis XVI.
and Marie Antoinette. The same characteristic is
noticeable in many of his actions. Perhaps it is
going to extremes to describe his origination of the
Legend of Honour as a piece of snobbery, but his
other arrangements for the provision of a titled
nobility are strongly indicative of this curious stray
littleness of mind. No one reading his letters can
doubt that he preferred speaking of Monsieur le
Maréchal Prince d’Essling, Duc de Rivoli, Grand
Aigle de la Légion d’Honneur to speaking of plain
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
General Masséna. He delighted in seeing about
him Grand Constables, Arch-Chancellors, Grand
Chamberlains; it pleased him to walk midst Grand
Dukes and Princesses; he preferred conversation
with the not over-talented Queen of Prussia to
any interview with Goethe. Characteristically, he
once invited an actor to come and perform before
a “Parterre of Kings.” It may perhaps be pleaded
that his painstaking care in the regulation of precedence,
and his minute examination of forms and
ceremonies were due to his desire to have his Imperial
arrangements perfect, but it may be pleaded with
equal justice that he entered voluntarily into these
arrangements. The Imperial dignity was not forced
upon him; he lost as many adherents by his assumption
of it as he gained. For all this, once Napoleon
decided upon indulging his snobbery, he indulged in
such a manner as to gain most profit by it. Just as
his delight in military matters tended towards the
improvement of his army, so his snobbery tended
towards buttressing his throne. Napoleon took
advantage of his own weaknesses just as he did of
other people’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One searches in vain for other prominent
characteristics. The selfishness so often attributed
to him is not so much the selfishness of Napoleon as
the selfishness of the Emperor. One cannot call
selfish the young lieutenant who took upon himself
the maintenance of a brother when his sole income
was thirty pounds a year, nor the man who gave
crowns and fiefs and fortunes to his friends, but the
Emperor who pried jealously into the management
of his subject kingdoms and took them back if he
saw fit, the Emperor who refused to share his
glory with his general, the Emperor who sacrificed
thousands of lives in order to hold down Europe was
selfish because he believed the Imperial power would
suffer were he unselfish. Even the ambition with
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
which he is usually credited does not appear on close
examination to be very remarkable or extraordinary.
Ambition is, after all, one of the commonest of
human traits, and varies only in degree and not in
occurrence. When Napoleon was a young man he
wanted to “get on”; he “got on” partly through
abundance of opportunity and partly through his
extraordinary talent. If it be said that he succeeded
through the force of his ambition, it can easily be
countered that most of the men who have ever
succeeded were ambitious. A quite plausible life of
Napoleon might be written showing that he was
entirely the reverse of ambitious, and that all the
steps of his career towards power from the day of his
receiving the command of the army of Italy to his
invasion of Russia in 1812, were forced upon him.
At the beginning of his career Napoleon had far less
chance of gaining supreme power than had Hoche,
or Pichegru, or Jourdan, or Moreau, but his rivals
dropped out of the race through early deaths, sheer
folly, or, perhaps in the case of Moreau, mere inertia.
Napoleon is believed to have schemed to seize the
reins of government as early as 1797, but half a dozen
others, including even Bernadotte and Augereau, did
the same. Napoleon was lucky, vigorous, and far
more gifted than they, and it was into his hands that
the ripened fruit dropped. From 1799 on, from the
Consulate to the Consulate for life, from the Consulate
for life to the Empire of the French, from the
Empire of the French to the visionary Empire of
the West, were steps which he could hardly have
avoided taking in some form or other if he wished to
retain any power at all. The attempt to enforce the
Continental System undoubtedly led him further
forward than was wise or than he desired. Had
Bonaparte been a Washington, he might have retired
after the peace of Amiens, but it is perfectly possible
that even if a series of Washingtons had succeeded
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
him, the last of them would have been beaten in a
great battle some ten years later by the armies of an
alliance of nations which had for some time back been
oppressed and enslaved in increasing degree by the
French. Undoubtedly this train of reasoning is
forced and unsound in some respects, but it certainly
gives a great deal of plausibility to the theory that
Napoleon’s ambition was not so far-reaching and
impossibly aspiring as it is sometimes carelessly said
to have been. In addition, it is necessary to
remember that his restless energy must occasionally
have spurred him to further action while a lazier man
would have remained tranquil. This is possibly an
explanation of his suicidal plunge into Spanish affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In like fashion the other indications of Napoleon’s
character are faint and colourless. Women had no
vast attraction for him; he appreciated them as a
physical necessity, but that was all. Undoubtedly
he ranked women in his mind along with exercise and
medicine, as things without which men are liable to
deteriorate. Wit and humour had very little meaning
for him—as witness his distaste for Molière—and
Art had even less. He ransacked Europe to fill
the Louvre with masterpieces, but he himself did not
enjoy them. He was careless of his ease, of his
attire, of his comfort. When he fell from power, he
did not seem to resent it very much. There is a story
of his having attempted suicide after his abdication
in 1814, but it is much to be doubted. The details
seem far more in agreement with the symptoms of
his mysterious illness, or of the malignant disease of
which he died a few years later. He did not seem
vastly depressed at Elba, or even at St. Helena.
Comparable to this lack of depression is his hopefulness
during the hopeless campaign of 1814. He
stood to lose so much, and he lost so much, but
neither the possibility nor the loss weighed upon him
unbearably. Perhaps he was confident that more
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
greatness awaited him in the future; perhaps he
simply did not care. The furious rages in which
Napoleon sometimes indulged seem to have been
merely good acting; he himself admitted that he
never allowed his rage to mount higher than his
chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another human trait which was wanting in
Napoleon was the capacity for hatred. With his
Corsican upbringing one might have expected to
find him at feud with numbers of people, but he was
not. Napoleon was not a good hater. He never
hated Pozzo di Borgo, for instance, half as much as
Pozzo hated him. He took violent dislikes to a
few individuals, but he frequently overcame these
in course of time. Macdonald is a case in point.
Hating must be distinguished from despising.
Napoleon despised the Spanish and Neapolitan
Bourbons, but he did not hate them. He waged war
after war on Francis of Austria, but he never admitted
any personal dislike. Hatred and affection were
alike unknown to Napoleon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are one or two isolated examples of men
for whom Napoleon professed affection, but a good
deal of doubt surrounds the matter. Napoleon said
he was fond of Muiron, who gave up his life for him
at Arcola; he said he was fond of Duroc, the Grand
Marshal of the Palace, who was killed at Bautzen,
but it is significant that we do not hear much about
this affection in either case until after Duroc and
Muiron were both dead. More than one contemporary
writer, indeed, has hinted that Duroc disliked
Napoleon, although he did his duty in an exemplary
manner, while so little is known about Muiron that
we can be permitted to assume that the affection
Napoleon expressed after Duroc and he were dead
was a theatrical touch assumed for the purpose of
enlisting still more sympathy at St. Helena. This
is quite in accordance with what we know both of
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
Napoleon’s own nature and of his plan of campaign
while in exile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One more point. Napoleon habitually attributed
the lowest possible motives to all human actions.
His attitude was not so much cynical as uncomprehending
(though some people think that cynicism is
merely lack of comprehension); he simply could not
understand anyone making any self-sacrifice when
quite disinterested or altruistic. If anyone did, he
put it down to hysteria. The brave boys who died
for him in the filth and misery of twenty campaigns
were so enthusiastic, Napoleon thought, merely
because they were hysterical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This idea is plainly to be discerned on reading
Napoleon’s bulletins and proclamations. They are
all of them apparently designed to appeal to a sentimental
and hysterical public. Without doubt, they
did appeal to their readers, but one cannot help
feeling nowadays a sensation of distaste when looking
through them. They are unbearably reminiscent of
street corner oratory and of the flamboyant efforts of the
sensational press—appeals to hysteria pure and simple.
Moreover, it is also plain that Napoleon himself felt
none of these hysterical impulses—he was merely
working cold-bloodedly on the passions of a passionate
people. Napoleon was entirely unfamiliar with noble
instincts or with the idea of devotion. He laid claim
to them himself, of course, despite his disbelief in
them, but that was merely another method of capturing
the favour of the populace. Washington’s loftiness
of character was as much a sealed book to him
as would have been (had he lived to see it) Garibaldi’s
disinterested patriotism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the sympathy with nationalism which his
nephew later laboured so hard to attribute to him
was wanting; the man who could unite seven nationalities
into one state, and who tossed fragments of
territory from one power to another without consulting
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
anything beyond his own desires must of
necessity have cared nothing either for national or
individual sentiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We can sum up then by describing Napoleon as
the embodiment of enormous ability, unquenchable
energy, and—nothing else. He can be compared to
an unguarded store of high explosive; he was bound
to cause trouble wherever he settled. Once afforded
an opportunity he was certain to bring about unexpected
results, and, as it happened, the turmoil into
which France was flung just as he reached manhood
afforded a very early opportunity. Without morals
or ideals to restrain or guide him, he would cause
destruction wherever he went, like a runaway horse
or a motor lorry out of control. He was a Frankenstein
monster let loose on the world; the good he did
was as haphazard as the harm.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>O</span>FTEN and often it has been savagely pointed
out that Napoleon enjoyed greater good
fortune than anyone could with reason
expect. Every incident in Napoleon’s life, from his
employment by Barras in 1795 to the collapse of
Francis I.’s nerve in 1809, has been used to prove
this, while his later misfortunes have been casually
mentioned as being inevitable considering his careless
taking of risks. The former criticism is undoubtedly
fair, but the latter is open to serious disagreement,
and has hardly received the opposition it deserves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon’s domination of Europe from 1805
onwards depended entirely upon his military
supremacy; nobody would dream of saying that he
would have received the homage of the Confederation
of the Rhine, the submission of Prussia and the
co-operation of Austria simply because of the force
of his personality, if that personality had not also
been supported by the menace of four hundred
battalions. Consequently Napoleon’s policy could
not be questioned so long as his army was invincible,
and mistakes of policy could be rapidly erased by a
victory in the field. Similarly a military error was
of far more importance than a political one; if the
Bonapartes had never met with a defeat in battle
their line would still inevitably hold the throne of
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
France, with a ring of subject countries round them.
It is therefore of the first importance to inquire into
the failure of the army; the other failures are merely
secondary. Thus if anyone says that he has just
quitted a certain building for three reasons, one of
them being that he was thrown out, the other two
reasons are of secondary importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Various dates have been assigned to the commencement
of the decline of Napoleon’s military
ascendancy, and the very fact that this is so proves
how difficult it is to be dogmatic on the subject.
Napoleon lost battles in 1807, and he won battles in
1813—and 1814 and 1815 for the matter of that.
The quality of the material at his disposal certainly
grew more and more inferior as time went on, but it
is easy to make too much of this point, for Napoleon
was <span class='it'>never</span> defeated except by superior numbers.
However, the first time he met with serious disaster
was, undoubtedly, in the campaign of 1812. The
catastrophe has been described times without
number; what has not so often been mentioned
is the nearness of Napoleon’s approach to another
triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Napoleonic army never took the field without
the full expectation of losing half its numbers
through hardship, as distinct from the action of the
enemy. This was the price it paid for its rapidity of
marching and its freedom from a rigid dependence
upon its base. If Napoleon led half a million men to
attack Russia, he expected to lose a quarter of a
million before he was in a position to gain a decisive
success; he certainly lost the quarter million, and he
certainly gained a success, but the losses continued
and the success was not decisive. And yet on several
occasions it appeared as if a new Austerlitz or a new
Friedland were at hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The irony of the situation lies in the fact that in
1812 Napoleon took much more extensive measures
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
to ensure that losses due to poverty of supplies would
be minimized than he did in any other campaign.
He organized an elaborate Intendance, with vast
trains of wagons, and he collected enormous depôts
of stores wherever possible. The system broke down
almost at once, partly on account of the inexperience
of the commissariat staff, partly because of torrential
rains which ruined the roads as soon as the army
started, and partly because the army and train were
so huge that they had already absorbed every available
horse in Europe, so that losses (which necessarily
increased with the distance marched from the depôts)
could not be replaced at all. This threw additional
work on the surviving horses, thereby increasing the
wastage, so that the Intendance went to pieces at a
rate increasing by geometrical progression. Before
very long the Grand Army was once more dependent
entirely on the country through which it marched,
and the numbers were vast and Lithuania and White
Russia were miserably poor. It was a combination
of circumstances apparently almost justifying the
Russian boast that God was on their side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet matters were not progressing any too well
for the Russians. Their field army was hopelessly
divided; one portion, from the Danube, could not be
expected for months, while of the other two parts
one was almost in the clutches of the French, and
the two together were hopelessly inferior in numbers
to the forces at Napoleon’s disposal. The tide of
war came surging back across Russia; the Russians
were marching desperately to escape from the trap;
the French were pursuing equally desperately in the
hope of closing the last avenue of escape. The
balance wavered, but at length turned in favour of
the Czar. The roads were mere mud tracks, churned
by the Russians into quagmires, and the French were
delayed. Jerome Bonaparte was not as insistent on
speed as he might have been, and at last, after fierce
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
rearguard fighting, Bagration escaped from the snare
laid for him. A little more—ever so little!—and
Smolensk might have been another Ulm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two main Russian armies were now combined,
and, a hundred and twenty thousand strong,
with a numerous cavalry, they were able to sweep the
country bare before the French advance. Had the
French movements round Smolensk been successful,
the Russians would have had only half these numbers,
and they would probably have been panic-stricken
in addition; the French advance would have been
proportionately easier and less expensive. In fact, it
is difficult to see how Russia could have continued
the war, for Alexander’s nerve would have been
shaken, the war party would have received a severe
rebuff, and altogether an entirely different atmosphere
would have arisen. The Russians fell slowly
back towards Moscow, the French, starving and
disease-ridden, toiled painfully after them. Barclay
de Tolly was relieved from his command in consequence
of his inaction, and Kutusoff, the disciple of
the great Suvaroff, took his place. A battle was
fought at Borodino. For Napoleon, it was the first
victory which did not give him huge captures of
prisoners and the prompt and abject submission of
his enemies; for the Russians it seemed as good as
a victory, for they had met the great conqueror
<span class='it'>en rase campagne</span>, and had escaped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet they should not have done. The late Lord
Wolseley declares that Napoleon’s plan of attack at
Borodino “could not be more perfectly conceived or
better elaborated,” and he goes on to say that it was
a sudden attack of illness which prevented Napoleon
from controlling the battle when it reached its height,
and from sending adequate supports to Ney at the
crucial moment. This is the first mention we find of
the mysterious illness on which a large number of
writers lay so much stress; in the next campaign we
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
shall find a much more important example. But
whether Napoleon was ill or not, a little better
luck for Ney or Davout would certainly have
brought about important results. The destruction
of Kutusoff’s army would have had a great effect
on the rest of the campaign, even if it had not
appalled Alexander into making peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next mistake of the Emperor’s was in staying
too long at Moscow; during the five weeks he spent
there his own army became demoralized, the Russians
had time to rally and to bring up the Army of the
Danube, and winter closed down on the countryside.
When at last Napoleon decided to retreat Kutusoff
was able at Malo-Jaroslavetz to bar the way to
Kaluga, and to force him to go back through the
pillaged districts through which he had come; this
could mean nothing less than the destruction of his
army, and, as everyone knows, the Grand Army was
destroyed. It is needless here to tell once more the
tale of the Beresina and Krasnoi; the interest of
“what might have been” ceases with the battle of
Malo-Jaroslavetz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The points to be remembered are that during the
fighting round Smolensk Napoleon was within a hairbreadth
of an overwhelming victory; at Borodino he
might have gained a satisfactory victory; a prompt
retreat from Moscow would at least have minimized
disaster; a success at Malo-Jaroslavetz would have
saved part of the army, while the check which was
actually experienced here was due to the accumulated
effects of the earlier bad luck. In a military sense
the campaign of 1812 was not merely justifiable but
it was very nearly justified. A little—a very little
more thrown into the scale would have saved his
Empire for Napoleon and set him on a higher throne
than ever before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The campaign of 1813 was in this sense even
more striking. It was waged with untrained,
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
immature forces, for the most part against overwhelming
odds, but during the course of the fighting
Napoleon was not once, but many times, within an
ace of successes more splendid than Austerlitz. The
actions of the Allies seemed to portend failure for
them from the start. Although Prussia joined
Russia as soon as the extent of the French disaster
became known; although there was nothing to bar
their way except a few thousand starving survivors
of the Grand Army; although all Germany was
in a ferment, and the French domination of the
Rhenish Confederation was tottering, the Russians
advanced with pitiful caution and delay. Napoleon
had returned to Paris, had raised, organized, equipped
and set in motion a new army of a quarter of a
million men by the time the Russians reached the
Elbe. Almost before the Russian commander-in-chief,
Wittgenstein, knew what was happening,
Napoleon had rushed back at the head of his new
army, had won the battle of Lützen, had reconquered
Saxony, and had flung the Allied army back across
the Oder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Bautzen they stood once more to fight.
Napoleon drew up the most gigantic battle plan ever
conceived up to that time; with half his force he
assailed the Allied centre, while Ney with sixty
thousand men marched against the right. The
struggle lasted for twelve bitter hours. Somehow
Napoleon held his own command together and
kept the Allies pinned to their position, while Ney
was slowly wheeling his immense force round for
the decisive movement. But the stars in their
courses fought against the Emperor. Ney failed
lamentably. He lost sight of the main object of his
march, and he showed his hand and then wasted his
strength in a fierce attack on Blücher at Preistitz.
Blücher struggled gamely; more and more of Ney’s
forces were drawn into the fight; the turning movement
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
was delayed, and the Allies, warned in time,
writhed out of the trap. Fifty thousand prisoners
and two hundred guns might have been captured; as
it was, Napoleon was left to deplore a massacre—for
nothing! Alluding to Soult’s capture of Badajoz in
1811, Napoleon had said, “Soult gained me a town
and lost me a kingdom.” He might well have said
of Ney’s attack on Preistitz that Ney gained him a
village and lost him an Empire. It is inconceivable
that the war could have been prolonged if Ney had
obeyed orders at Bautzen; the allied army comprised
all the troops that Russia and Prussia could at that
time put into the field; its destruction would have
meant the reconquest of Prussia and of Poland,
the intimidation of Austria, and the regaining of
Napoleon’s European ascendancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Bautzen Napoleon concluded an armistice
with his enemies. He still hoped for an advantageous
peace, and even if he failed to obtain this he
expected that the delay would enable him to rest
the weary boys who filled the ranks, to drill his
wretched cavalry into some semblance of order, and
to clear his rear of the bandits and partisans who
were swarming everywhere. Moreover, for the last
eighteen months he had been working at a pace
which would have killed most men, and he himself
was undoubtedly feeling the strain. The armistice
would give him a little rest. But it meant disaster,
nevertheless. From all over Russia new recruits
were plodding across the unending plains to fill the
gaps in the ranks of the field army; Prussia was
calling out her whole male population, and Bernadotte’s
Swedes were gradually moving up into line.
Worse than all, Austria turned against him. The
delay enabled Francis to bring his army up to war
strength on the receipt of lavish English subsidies,
and, even while he still hesitated to attack his son-in-law,
the news arrived that Wellington had routed
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
Joseph Bonaparte at Vittoria, had cleared Spain of
the French, and was about to attack the sacred soil
of France herself. The news was decisive, and the
demands of the Allies promptly increased inordinately.
When, in August, the armistice came to an
end, Napoleon found himself assailed by forces of
twice his strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet he did not despair; he thrust fiercely into
Silesia, and then, finding the Austrians moving
against Dresden, he wheeled about, marched a
hundred and twenty miles in four days, and gained
at Dresden the most surprising of all his victories.
With a hundred thousand men he flung back a
hundred and sixty thousand Russians and Austrians
in utter disorder; Vandamme had cut off their
retreat, and once again it seemed as if Ulm and
Austerlitz were to be repeated. And then once
more occurred a startling change of fortune.
Napoleon might have taken a hundred thousand
prisoners; the Emperors of Austria and of Russia
might have fallen into his power; Austria would
have been ruined, and Napoleon could have dictated
peace on his own terms. But Napoleon handed over
the pursuit to Murat and St. Cyr, and returned to
Dresden. In consequence, the retreating Austrians
were not pressed, Vandamme was overwhelmed, and
the action at Kulm gave the Allies twenty thousand
prisoners instead of placing the whole Allied army
in the hands of the French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one knows why Napoleon returned to
Dresden when victory was in his grasp. The
advocates of the illness theory certainly have a
strong case here; but perhaps it was news of the
disasters in Silesia which recalled him; perhaps he
was merely too tired to continue; perhaps he only
had a bad cold as the result of sitting his horse all
day in the pelting rain which fell all day during the
battle of Dresden. However it was, Napoleon’s
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
mastership of Europe was lost irreparably when he
came to his decision to leave his army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For two months disaster now followed disaster.
Macdonald had already been routed on the Katzbach;
Oudinot was beaten at Gross Beeren, Ney was beaten
at Dennewitz, St. Cyr surrendered at Dresden, and
Napoleon himself tasted the bitter cup of defeat at
Leipzig. The astonishing feature of the autumn
campaign of 1813 was not that Napoleon was
defeated, but that he ever escaped from Germany
at all. But he did, blotting out on his path the
Bavarian army which opposed him at Hanau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again the Allies advanced too slowly, and
once again Napoleon was able to organize a fresh
army to defend France. Soult had grappled with
Wellington in the south, and was stubbornly contesting
every inch of French soil in his desperate
campaign of Toulouse. Napoleon prepared to make
one more effort for success in the north. Russia,
Austria, Prussia, Sweden, the Confederation of the
Rhine, Holland and even Belgium had sent every
man available against him. Four hundred thousand
men were about to pass the Rhine while Napoleon
had not a quarter of this force with which to oppose
them. However, the prospect was not as hopeless
as it would appear. The Allies were bitterly jealous
of each other, and Napoleon had good grounds for
hoping to divide them even now. Besides, they were
all of them intent upon gaining possession of whatever
territory they wished to claim at the conclusion of
peace, and an army guided solely by political motives
is at the mercy of another which is directed only in
accordance with the dictates of military strategy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This early became obvious. Austria had bought
the alliance of the smaller German states only by
means of extensive guarantees of their possessions;
in consequence she determined to find compensation
for her losses by acquisitions in Italy. But Italy
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
was stoutly defended by the Viceroy Eugène; she
could make no progress there, and in consequence
she did not yet desire Napoleon’s fall. Schwartzenberg,
the Austrian general, was therefore held back
by Metternich’s secret orders until Venetia and
Lombardy should be in Austrian hands. Metternich
was quite capable of leaving the Russians and
Prussians in the lurch while he played his own
tortuous game; however, the situation was saved
by Murat’s betrayal of Napoleon. With Murat on
his side, and the Neapolitan army moving forward
against Eugène, Metternich was sure of Italy, and
Schwartzenberg was allowed to proceed into France.
Once more the weakness and treachery of a subordinate
had prevented Napoleon from gaining a decisive
success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prospect grew gloomier and gloomier for
the French. Napoleon was beaten at Brienne and
at La Rothière; immediate and utter ruin seemed
inevitable. Suddenly everything was changed.
Napoleon fell upon the dispersed army of the
Allies. At Champ-Aubert, Vauchamp, Château-Thierry
and Mormant the Allies were beaten and
hurled back. More than this, the Prussians under
Blücher, thirty thousand strong, hard pressed by
Napoleon, came reeling back towards Soissons and
the Marne—and Soissons was held by a French
garrison. With an unfordable river before him;
the only bridge held by the enemy; a panic-stricken
army under his command, and Napoleon and his
unbeaten Frenchmen, flushed with victory, at his
heels, Blücher seemed doomed to destruction. The
officer in command at Soissons bore the ominous
name of Moreau; he was intimidated into surrender
when one more day’s defence would have had
incalculable results. Blücher escaped across the
Marne not a minute too soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was Napoleon’s last chance before his
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
abdication. His armies were weakened even by their
victories; the Allied forces seemed inexhaustible.
All Napoleon’s efforts were unavailing; his final
threat at Schwartzenberg’s communications was
disregarded, and the Allies reached Paris. Marmont’s
surrender here has often been brought
forward as one more instance of treachery in high
places, but it was not treachery, it was only timidity
and fear of responsibility. One cannot imagine
Blücher surrendering under similar circumstances.
Be that as it may, Paris fell, and Napoleon abdicated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the abdication came the descent from
Elba; after the descent from Elba came the Hundred
Days; and at the end of the Hundred Days came the
Waterloo campaign. It was during the Waterloo
campaign that there occurred, not one but half a
dozen chances for Napoleon to win the decisive
victory for which he had been striving ever since
1812, but all these half-dozen chances were spoilt
by unexpected happenings and by sheer hard luck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many critics have inveighed against Napoleon’s
decision to take the initiative into his own hands
and to carry the war into the enemy’s camp by
his invasion of Belgium, but there is hardly one
who can find any fault with the plan of invasion
once it had been decided upon. The chief fault-finder,
indeed, is Wellington, who, to his dying
day, maintained that the movement should have
been commenced through Mons, against the English
right, and not through Charleroi, against their left.
However, Wellington’s opinion on this matter does
not carry as much weight as it might, because the
Iron Duke was guilty of several serious mistakes
during the campaign, and was only too anxious to
draw any red herring that offered across their trail,
especially as these mistakes were nearly all committed
while he was under the impression that Napoleon’s
ultimate objective was his right and not his centre.
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
The whole weight of later opinion is in favour of
Napoleon’s plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon decided, then, to invade Belgium via
Charleroi, to interpose between the Prussian and
the Anglo-Allied armies and defeat them in detail.
The fact that he had only 130,000 men against
120,000 Prussians and 100,000 English and Allies
does not seem to have caused him any grave
apprehension. The greatest handicap under which
he suffered was the absence of Berthier and Davout;
both staff work and the higher commands suffered
because of this, for Soult had no aptitude for the
task of Chief of Staff, and Ney and Grouchy had
no skill either in higher strategy or in the handling
of large numbers of men. Nevertheless, the initial
movements, without the interference of the enemy,
were carried out with brilliant success; the 130,000
men available were assembled on the Sambre without
either Blücher or Wellington having any suspicion
as to the storm that was gathering. Next day the
advance across the Sambre was ordered, and the
storm burst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two vitally important factors for success
were extreme simplicity of movement and the
utmost secrecy of design. But these were rendered
impossible at the very moment of the opening of
the campaign. First, a general of division, as soon
as he was over the river, deserted to the Prussians and
disclosed the very considerable information of which
he was possessed, and secondly the officer bearing
orders to Vandamme to advance met with an accident
and broke his leg. This held up both Vandamme’s
corps and the one behind it, Lobau’s, and delayed
the advance after the movement had become known
for six valuable hours. All chance of surprising the
Prussians in their cantonments was now lost, but for
all that the plan of campaign was so perfect that on
the next day the English and Prussians could only
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
bring slightly superior numbers to bear on the French
force. At Ligny the Prussians were beaten; at
Quatre Bras the English were held back. Ney’s
and d’Erlon’s mistakes on this day have already
been described. Had Ney acted with all possible
diligence, or had d’Erlon used his wits, either a
completely crushing victory over the Prussians or a
nearly equally satisfactory success over the English
could have been obtained. Even both were possible.
But Napoleon’s chance was spoiled owing to the
inefficiency of his subordinates. Soult, Ney and
d’Erlon were all equally to blame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next point is more mysterious. After Ligny
was fought and won, it was clearly to Napoleon’s
advantage to follow up his success without a moment’s
delay. No other general had ever been so remorseless
in hunting down a beaten enemy, and in wringing
every possible advantage from his victory. But at
Digny Napoleon paused. No order for an advance
was issued. For twelve hours paralysis descended
upon the Imperial army. The Prussians struggled
out of harm’s way, and crawled painfully by by-roads
to Wavre to keep in touch with the English.
The cavalry reconnaissances which were sent out
later the next morning to find the Prussian army
did their work badly, and left Napoleon convinced
that they had fallen back on Liège and not on
Wavre. It was the delay, however, and not the
faulty scouting, which proved most disastrous. Like
Napoleon’s return to Dresden in 1813, it has never
been explained. Some historians say that he was
struck down by an attack of the same nameless
illness which had overcome him at Borodino, at
Moscow, at Dresden and at Leipzig. In this case
it is the only possible explanation. For four or five
hours Napoleon must have suffered from a complete
lapse of his faculties. Those four or five hours were
sufficient to ruin the Empire. Napoleon was left
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
completely in the dark as to the moral, strength and
position of the Prussians, and consequently he
detached Grouchy with ambiguous orders in pursuit,
gave him a force too small for decisive operations
and yet much too large for mere observation, and
sent him by a route which precluded him either from
assisting the main body or from interfering seriously
with the operations of the Prussians. Grouchy
might possibly have done both if only he had
possessed vast insight, vast skill and vast determination,
but he did not; he was merely ordinary. So
Wellington turned to bay at Waterloo; the Prussians
assailed Napoleon’s flank, and the day ended in
despair and disaster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, on looking back through the years of
defeat, 1812, 1813, 1814 and 1815, we find that
there were a great number of occasions when
Napoleon might have gained a success which would
have counter-balanced the previous reverses. At
Smolensk he might have gained another Friedland;
at Borodino he might still have snatched some slight
triumph out of the Moscow campaign. At Bautzen
he came within an ace of destroying the Russian and
Prussian armies, at Dresden he nearly captured the
whole Austrian army and the two most powerful
autocrats of Europe. The surrender of Soissons just
saved the Prussians in 1814. In 1815 he might have
shattered either or both of the armies opposed to him.
It is not too much to say that with the good luck
which had attended him during his earlier campaigns
not only might he not have been forced to abdicate
in 1814, but he might have enjoyed his continental
ascendancy for a very considerable additional length
of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside these undoubted possibilities there are
others not as firmly based. Marbot tells a story that
on the eve of Leipzig, while at the head of his
Chasseurs, he saw a party of horsemen moving about
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
in the darkness a short distance ahead. For various
reasons he refrained from attacking—to discover later
that the hostile force had consisted of the King of
Prussia, the Emperors of Austria and Russia, and
their staffs. A resolute charge by Marbot would have
brought back as prisoners all the brains and authority
of the opposing army. The Spanish victory at
Pavia, when Francis the First lost “everything
except honour,” would have been a poor success in
comparison. We have, however, only Marbot’s word
for this incident, and Marbot is distinctly untrustworthy.
Edward III.’s army was not the only one
which used the long bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is more to the purpose to consider Dupont’s
surrender at Baylen. When Dupont was sent out
from Madrid to conquer Andalusia, there was only
one Spanish field army in being, and that was the
one he was to attack. As it happened, his nerve
failed him, he frittered away weeks of valuable time,
and finally he was hemmed in and forced to surrender
rather feebly. The news of the disaster spread like
wildfire over the Peninsula. Moncey was repulsed
from Valencia; Catalonia broke into insurrection
and hemmed Duhesme into Barcelona. Galicia and
Aragon began to arm. The Peninsular War was
soon fully developed; it was to absorb the energies of
an army of three hundred thousand men for five
years; it was to shed the blood of half a million
Frenchmen; it was to encourage first Austria, then
Russia, to rebel against the Napoleonic domination,
and it was only to end when the British flag waved
over Bordeaux and Toulouse. Had Lannes or some
other really capable officer been in command of
Dupont’s twenty thousand men, the Army of
Andalusia might have been thoroughly beaten and
the Peninsula overawed, for Baylen was the battle
which destroyed the French army’s reputation for
invincibility. Had not the Spaniards been victorious
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
there, there would not have been an opportunity for
the simultaneous call to arms which set all Spain in
an inextinguishable blaze; isolated outbreaks might
naturally have occurred, but the long respite given
to the Spaniards during the summer of 1808, while
Madrid was evacuated, would not have taken place
to give the Peninsula its opportunity for arming
and organizing. Baylen is as great a turning-point
in Napoleonic history as even Bautzen or Leipzig—and
but for Dupont history might have turned in
another direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instances such as this might be multiplied
indefinitely, from Marmont at El Bodin (where he
hesitated when half the British army was in his
power) to Jourdan in his retreat to Vittoria; from
Jerome’s mismanagement of Westphalia to Ney at
Dennewitz; but it is useless to continue. It is
obvious that Napoleon’s military set-backs were due
very largely, not to his own failings, but to the
incapacity of his subordinates. Napoleon made mistakes,
enormous ones, sometimes (a few will be considered
in the next chapter), but none of them as
utterly fatal as those of the other generals. And yet
these other generals were quite good generals as far
as generals go—they were far and away superior
to Schwartzenberg and Wittgenstein, for instance.
Only Wellington and perhaps Blücher can be compared
to them. The only moral to be drawn is that
nothing human and fallible could sustain the vast
Empire any longer; the dead weight of the whole
was such that the least flaw in any of the pillars
meant the progressive collapse of the entire fabric.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This conclusion enables us to approach a definite
decision as to “what might have been.” It is
unnecessary to argue as to whether the English
Cabinet would have survived a defeat at Waterloo,
or whether Francis would have made peace if he had
been captured at Dresden. The result eventually
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>
would have been the same. There was only one
Napoleon, and the Empire was too big for him to
govern. Sooner or later something would go wrong,
and the disturbance would increase in geometrical
progression, and with a violence directly proportionate
to the length of time during which the repressive
force had been in action. It was inevitable that the
Empire should fall, although as it happened the fall
was accelerated by a series of unfortunate incidents.
Victor Hugo meant the same thing when he said
“God was bored with Napoleon”; and Napoleon
himself had occasional glimpses of the same inevitable
result—as witness the occasion when he said, “After
me, my son will be lucky if he has a few thousand
francs a year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, if Napoleon by good fortune had reestablished
his Empire in 1813, and taken advantage
(just as he did in 1810) of peace in the east to
reconquer Spain in the south, even then he would
not long have retained his throne. The persistent
enmity of England would have continued to injure
him, and to seek out some weak spot for the decisive
blow. Even if Ferdinand had been sent back to
Spain, and French prestige survived such a reverse,
there would have still remained various avenues of
attack. England was suffering severely, but France
was suffering more. Perhaps the patience of the
French would have become exhausted, and some
trivial revolt in Paris would have driven Napoleon
into exile. A very similar thing happened in 1830,
and the house of Orleans was always anxiously
awaiting some such chance. There could hardly
have arisen a Napoleonic Legend in that event. To
the French mind Napoleon the Great and Napoleon
the Little would have been the same person, instead
of uncle and nephew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However it was, Napoleon was not destined to
live long, and even if his Empire had survived him,
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
at his death one can hardly imagine Europe remaining
under the thumb of any Council of Regency he
might appoint, with Joseph and Jerome and the
Murats all scheming and conspiring to grasp the
main power. Poor silly Marie Louise could never
have kept order; some Monk would have arisen to
restore the Bourbons, and Napoleon II. would have
received the same treatment as did Richard Cromwell.
The legend of l’Aiglon would then have been very
different. A Bonaparte restoration in France might
be as feasible as ever was a Protectorate restoration
in England. Not all Louis Napoleon’s wiles could
have built up a reactionary party; not all the glamour
of Austerlitz and Jena could have masked the discredit
of a new dynasty being cast out by its own
people instead of by a league of indignant autocrats;
even Sedan was not the death-blow to Bonapartism.
As it is, there will be a Third Empire in France as
soon as there arises a Napoleon the Fourth.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>T was Napoleon’s fate, during his lifetime and
for some time after, to have his worst mistakes
overlooked, and to have various strokes of policy
violently condemned as shocking errors. Everyone
has heard the execution of the Duc d’Enghien spoken
of as “worse than a crime—it was a blunder.” It
is difficult to see why. Perhaps Fouché, to whom
the remark is attributed, did not see why either. If
a man should happen to think of an epigram of that
brilliancy, it is hard to condemn him for using it
without troubling much as to its truth. But whether
launched in good faith or not, that shaft of wit sped
most accurately to its mark, and proved so efficiently
barbed that it has stuck ever since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The real point was that France was at war with
England at the time, and that Napoleon was so
universally dreaded that any stick was considered
good enough to beat him with. Consequently a
storm of indignation arose, diligently fostered by
those who benefited, and soon all Europe was furious
that a poor dear Bourbon had been shot. If nowadays
the President of the German Republic were to
lay hold of a young Hohenzollern and shoot him on
a charge of conspiracy, it is doubtful whether it
would cause any similar stir. Europe is not fond of
Hohenzollerns, and the principle of Legitimacy is so
far discredited that it is not considered blasphemy to
treat the descendant of an autocrat with violence.
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Undoubtedly it was a crime for Napoleon to
shoot the Duke, but it was hardly a blunder. It was
contrary to international law for him to send the
expedition to Ettenheim which arrested d’Enghien;
it was contrary to statutory law to try him without
allowing him to make any defence; it was contrary
to moral law to shoot him for an offence of which
he was not guilty. For all this Napoleon deserves
the utmost possible censure—but without doubt he
profited largely. Everywhere among Napoleon’s
enemies arose a weeping and wailing; the English
poured out indignant seas of ink (in 1914 they
wrote in much the same fashion about Wilhelm of
Germany’s withered arm). Alexander of Russia put
his Court in mourning (only three years before he
had been cognisant of the plot which brought about
the murder of his own father); the King of Sweden
tried to organize a crusade of revenge; but a month
after d’Enghien died the Senate begged Napoleon
to assume the Imperial title. It is curious, indeed,
that so much notice should have been taken of one
more murder by a generation which witnessed, without
one quarter so much emotion, the partition of
Poland, the storming of Praga, the sack of Badajoz,
the shooting of Ney, and Wellington’s devastation
of the Tagus Valley. The art of propaganda was at
quite a high level even more than a century ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again, the execution of d’Enghien was a
crime and not a mistake. By it Napoleon showed
that he was no mere Monk dallying with the idea of
restoring the Bourbons. He brought to his support
all the most determined of the irreconcilables. He
showed the monarchs of Europe that he was a man
to be reckoned with. Murat, Savary, everyone
implicated was cut off from all possible communication
with the Bourbons. The deed cowed the Pope
into submission at a vitally important moment, while
the mere mention of it later was sufficient to frighten
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
the wretched Ferdinand of Spain into abject obedience
at that strange conference at Bayonne, when an
idiotic father and a craven son handed the crown of
Charles V. to an incompetent upstart. But Napoleon
would have met with no more than he deserved had
he had dealt out to him at Fontainebleau in 1814 the
same tender mercy which Condé’s heir received at
Vincennes ten years before—ten years almost to the
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Enghien’s execution were a crime but not a
mistake, there are several incidents, most of them
occurring about the same time, which undoubtedly
indicated mistakes, even if they were not crimes.
Thus Pichegru was found dead in prison. Pichegru
was one of the generals of the Republic, almost
worthy of ranking with Hoch and Kléber. He had
conquered Holland, and was credited with the
mythical exploit of capturing the frozen-in Dutch
fleet with a squadron of Hussars. (The Dutch had
obligingly forestalled this achievement by surrendering
some time previously.) Later he had been found
to be parleying with the Bourbons, and had been
disgraced and exiled. Returning at the time of
Cadoudal’s conspiracy, he had been arrested,
imprisoned—and was found one morning dead, with
a handkerchief round his neck which had been
twisted tight by means of a stick. Paris gossip
credited Napoleon with the guilt of his death, and
darkly hinted that his confidential Mamelukes had
revived the Oriental process of bowstringing. It is
hard to believe that Napoleon really was guilty, for
he could have secured Pichegru’s death by legal
methods had he wished, while if he wanted to kill
Pichegru quietly he could have adopted more subtle
means. The blunder lay in his allowing the circumstances
to become known; with his power he could
have arranged a much more satisfactory announcement
which would leave no doubt in men’s minds
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
that Pichegru really had committed suicide. In
consequence of his carelessness Napoleon was also
charged with the murder, a year later, of an English
naval officer, Captain Wright, who also committed
suicide in prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A more terrible mystery surrounds the death of
Villeneuve. This unfortunate man had been in
command at Trafalgar; he had been wounded and
taken prisoner, and had subsequently been sent back
to France. As soon as he landed he found that
Napoleon was furious with him as a consequence of
his defeat, and he was found dead in his room at
Rennes, with half a dozen knife-stabs in his body.
It was announced that he had committed suicide,
but there are several unpleasant facts in connection
with his death which point to another conclusion.
Letters from him to his wife and from his wife to
him had disappeared in the post; the manner of death
was strange, for the knife-thrusts were numerous
and one of them was so situated that it could hardly
have been self-inflicted. Perhaps Napoleon had
Villeneuve killed; perhaps the crime was committed
by over-zealous underlings; however it was, it was
a serious error on Napoleon’s part to have allowed
any room for gossip whatever. A possible motive
for the crime (if it was one) lies in the fact that
Napoleon was terribly anxious to keep secret the
news of Trafalgar; not until the Restoration was the
general French public acquainted with the fact that
the French fleet had been destroyed—Napoleon had
never admitted more than the loss of one or two ships.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was incidents of this nature which caused the
feeling of distrust which gradually arose in the minds
of the French people. Broken treaties and international
bad faith did not move them so much, partly
because they were never in possession of the true
facts, partly because a series of brilliant victories
wiped off the smudges from the slate, and partly
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
because international morality was at its usual low
ebb; but tales of official murder and of unsavoury
scandals in high places constitute the ideal food for
gossip, and rumours spread and were distorted in the
way rumours are, until a large section of the public
had lost its faith in the Emperor. As long as
Napoleon was successful in the field this defection
was unimportant, but as soon as his power began to
ebb it became decidedly noticeable, and, as much as
anything else, helped to reconcile the mass of the
people to the return of the Bourbons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been well said that the man who never
makes any mistakes never makes anything else, and
allied to this statement is Wellington’s famous
dictum (which applies equally well to all kinds of
endeavour) that the best general is not the one who
makes fewest mistakes, but the one who takes most
advantage of the mistakes of his opponent. On
examining Napoleon’s career one finds mistakes
innumerable—and the successes are more numerous
still. In military matters the explanation lies in the
extreme and elaborate care Napoleon devoted to his
strategic arrangements. His movements were so
planned that no tactical check could derange them.
His <span class='it'>bataillon carré</span> of a hundred thousand men, with
Lannes the incomparable at the head of the advanced
guard, could take care of itself whatever happened.
The advanced guard caught the enemy and pinned
him to his ground, providing that fixed point which
Napoleon always desired as a pivot, and then the
massed army could be wheeled with ease against
whatever part of the enemy’s line Napoleon selected.
If victory was the result, then the pursuit was relentless;
if perhaps a check was experienced, then the
previous strategy had been such that the damage
done was minimized. It was this system which
saved him at Eylau and which was so marvellously
successful at Friedland.
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The occasions when danger threatened or when
disaster occurred were those when Napoleon did not
act on these lines. The campaign of 1796, indeed,
shows no trace of the “Napoleonic system.” The
principles which Napoleon followed were only those
of the other generals of the period, but they were
acted upon with such vigour and with such a clarity
of vision that they were successful against all the
odds which the Aulic Council brought to bear. At
Marengo, on the other hand, the conditions were
different and more exacting. This victory had to be
as gratifying as possible to the French nation—it had
to be gained by extraordinary means; it had to be
as unlooked-for as a thunderbolt, as startling as it
was successful, and it must bring prodigious results.
Also (for Napoleon’s own sake) it had to be gained
as quickly as possible, so that he could return to Paris
to overcome his enemies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Austrians had overrun Italy, were besieging
Genoa, and had advanced to the Var. No mere
frontal attack upon them would fulfil all the onerous
conditions imposed upon the First Consul. A series
of successes painfully gained, resulting in the slow
driving of the Austrians from one river line to
another, might be safe, but it would not be dramatic
nor unexpected, and, worst of all, it would not be
rapid. Napoleon took an enormous risk, and led his
Army of Reserve over the Alps. He had satisfied
the need for drama; now he had to justify himself
by a speedy victory. Defeat, with an impassable
defile in his rear, meant nothing less than disaster;
but delay, with his enemies gradually rallying at
Paris, meant similar disaster. The strain became
unbearable, and Napoleon scattered his army far and
wide in his endeavour to come to grips with the
Austrians. The risk he ran was appalling, and was
almost fatal, for the fraction of the army which he
still retained under his own hand was suddenly
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
attacked by the combined Austrians, and driven
back. Napoleon flung himself into the battle; somehow
he kept his battered battalions together until
three undeserved strokes of luck occurred simultaneously.
Desaix arrived with his stray division; Zach
unduly extended the Austrian line; and Kellermann
was afforded an opportunity for a decisive charge.
In ten minutes the whole situation was changed.
Marengo was won; it was the Austrians who were
defeated without an avenue of retreat; and Napoleon
was free to enjoy the intoxication of supreme power—and
to meditate on the destiny which had saved
him from indescribable disgrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The errors into which Napoleon fell during the
campaign of 1805 were mainly the result of his overestimation
of his adversaries’ talents. No one could
possibly have imagined that Mack would have been
such a spiritless fool as to stay in Ulm and allow
himself to be surrounded by an army three times his
strength. Napoleon certainly did not expect him to,
and made his dispositions on the supposition that
Mack would endeavour to fight his way through to
Bohemia or Tyrol. But Mack remained paralysed;
the one gap left open was closed to him by Ney’s
dashing victory at Elchingen, and all that remained
to be done was for Napoleon to receive the timid
surrender of thirty thousand men and for Murat to
hunt down whatever fragments were still at large.
Five weeks later the Russians were destroyed at
Austerlitz. There is no manœuvre of Napoleon’s
during these five weeks at which anyone can reasonably
cavil; the faint criticism that Napoleon ought
not to have advanced as far as he did into Moravia
is easily falsified by the fact that by this means he
was able to find room for his retreat on Austerlitz
which gave so much heart to the Russians and which
induced them to make their ruinous attack on his
right wing.
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The mistakes which Napoleon made during the
Jena campaign have already been fully discussed.
He made several gross miscalculations, and his only
justification is his final success. As the war went on,
however, and the French advanced into Poland, we
find Napoleon at his very best strategically. At
Eylau he blundered in sending forward Augereau’s
corps in their mad rush at the powerful Russian line,
but once again he was able to extricate himself from
his difficulties, and Friedland settled the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is now that we come to the most disastrous
adventure of all—the Spanish affair. The remark
has been made that until 1808 Napoleon had only
fought kings, and never a people. He plunged into
the involved politics of Spain expecting as easy a
victory as Masséna’s conquest of Naples in 1806, or
Junot’s conquest of Portugal in 1807. He was sadly
mistaken. And yet one can find traces indicating
that he was taking all possible precautions. His
instructions to his representatives at Madrid certainly
suggest that he was trying to frighten the Spanish
royal family out of the country, and that only when
this scheme had been upset by the abdication of
Charles at Aranjuez (which could not possibly have
been foreseen) did he call the suicidal conference of
Bayonne. The Portuguese royal family had fled
from Junot; the Neapolitan Bourbons had fled from
Masséna; it might have been expected that the
Spanish Bourbons would have fled from Murat,
especially as they had rich American dependencies
in which to settle. The Spaniards would not have
fought half so hard for a craven King in America as
they did for one who was pictured to them as suffering
a martyr’s torments in a French prison. So far
Napoleon’s methods are perhaps justified in every
way except morally. But from this time onward he
made mistake after mistake. He entrusted the conquest
of Spain to officers and troops of poor quality—generals
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>
like Savary, Dupont and Duhesme, with
mere provisional regiments formed from the sweepings
of the depôts. The capitulation of Baylen and
the loss of Madrid were the natural consequence. In
wrath Napoleon called upon the Grand Army. He
plunged into Spain, routed the wretched Spanish
levies, pressed on to conquer all Spain and—was
forced to wheel back to counter Moore’s swift thrust
at his rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon never returned to the Peninsula. It
was not central enough; he could not from there
keep an eye on the rest of Europe. He endeavoured
instead to direct affairs from Paris, with the result
that what little order remained dissolved into chaos.
His despatches arrived six weeks late, and co-ordination
was impossible. The best course left open to
him was to entrust the supreme command in Spain
to the most capable of his subordinates, someone who
could make his plans on the spot and see that they
were carried out. But there Napoleon stopped short.
Give to another Frenchman the command of three
hundred thousand men and all the resources of a
vast kingdom? Unthinkable! So matters drifted
from bad to worse while the Marshals quarrelled
among themselves, while Joseph and Jourdan tried
to make their authority felt, and while Napoleon
blindly stirred up still further trouble among them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Worse than this; Napoleon entirely misread the
character of the Spanish war. Despite his own
experiences there, he did not realize the enormous
difficulties with which the French armies had to
contend. He set three hundred thousand men a
task which would have kept half a million fully
occupied, and he further hampered them by the
niggardly nature of their allowances of money and
material. He under-estimated the fighting power of
the guerillas, of the Portuguese levies, and (worst of
all) of the English army. He over-estimated the
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
power of his name among the unlettered Spanish
peasants. He left entirely out of account the
impossibility of communication and of supply. In
a word, there was no error open to him into which
he did not fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Spanish trouble had hardly assumed serious
dimensions when in 1809 Austria made one more
bid for freedom and commenced hostilities against
him. As busy as he could possibly be with Spanish
affairs, with troubles in Paris, and with ruling the
rest of Europe, Napoleon delayed before going in
person to the seat of war. He miscalculated the
time necessary to Austria to mobilize, and he
entrusted the temporary command to Berthier—two
grave errors. Only Davout’s skill and his own
unconquerable energy staved off a serious disaster
and snatched a victory from the jaws of defeat. The
French pressed on to Vienna. This time there was
no Auersperg to be cozened out of his command of
the Danube bridge; the crossings were all broken
down, and Napoleon was compelled to force a passage
in face of a hostile army of equal strength—the
most delicate operation known to military science.
Napoleon’s first attempt was rash to the verge of
madness. It was simply a blind thrust at the
heart of the opposing army; the bridges provided
were insufficient, and broke down through enemy
action at the crisis of the battle; the staff work
and the arrangements generally appear to have been
defective. Thirty-six hours of fierce fighting saw
the French hurled back again; Masséna’s tenacity
and Lannes’ daring saved the army from destruction,
but the cost of defeat amounted to twenty thousand
men—among them was Lannes, the hero of Montebello,
of Saalfeld, of Friedland, of Saragossa; one of
the few who dared to say what they thought to the
Emperor, and one of the few who enjoyed his trust
and friendship.
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>To point the moral, Napoleon contrived soon
afterwards to bring up huge reinforcements, and
then to cross the Danube without opposition. The
movement was carefully planned and carried out, and
the results were the victory of Wagram, the armistice
of Znaim, and the dismemberment of Austria. If,
after experiencing a severe defeat, Napoleon could
succeed in bringing up the Army of Italy and crossing
the Danube without opposition, he could surely
have done so at the first attempt. The battle of
Aspern is typical of Napoleon’s reckless methods
and of his under-estimation of the enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this campaign of 1809 Napoleon’s fall was
nearly anticipated. Had the forty thousand men
whom England sent to Walcheren, too late, been
despatched a little earlier, under a competent
general; had Prussia flung her weight into the
scale at the same time, it is hard to see how
Napoleon could have recovered himself. Germany
was already prepared to revolt, Tyrol was ablaze
with insurrection, Wellington was marching into
the heart of Spain, Russia was ready to change sides
at a moment’s notice. What saved Napoleon was
the fact that three of his enemies were timid and
incompetent. Chatham could achieve nothing in
the Netherlands; Frederick William III. hesitated
in Prussia, and Francis of Austria, although Wagram
was not in the least a crushing defeat, decided that
he could not continue the struggle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have already dealt in part with 1812 and
1813. There are mistakes in plenty here, although
now they were accentuated by the worst of ill luck.
The whole advance into Russia was one gigantic
error; not even Napoleon’s tremendous efforts could
counter-balance the handicaps which he encountered,
and which he ought to have foreseen. As far back
as 1807 he had commented bitterly on the horrible
Polish roads and on the clinging black mud of that
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>
district; he should have realized that it was impossible
for him to feed an army five hundred thousand strong
by road transport under such conditions. Nevertheless,
he nearly succeeded at Smolensk in countering
a strategic disadvantage by a tactical victory, in the
same manner as he had done twelve years before
at Marengo. Even after utter ruin had descended
upon him, he contrived by his gigantic labours to
raise a new army and to enter afresh into the field
in 1813 before his enemies were ready for him. The
early movements in the campaign are practically
perfect; until after Bautzen he showed all his old
brilliancy and skill—negatived this time by the
mistakes of subordinates. But from Bautzen
onwards we find repeated errors both in policy and
in the field. It was a mistake to enter into the
armistice of Pleisswitz; it was a mistake not to
secure the neutrality of Austria, even if it had cost
him the whole Kingdom of Italy; it was a mistake
not to accept the Allies’ offers of peace; it was a
mistake not to send back Ferdinand to Spain and
extricate himself somehow from the tangle of the
Peninsular War; it was a mistake to send Oudinot
and Ney against Berlin; it was a mistake to try to
hold the line of the Elbe; it was a mistake to fight
at Leipzig; and, having decided to fight, it was a
mistake not to see that there was a satisfactory line
of retreat over the Elster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is clear that Napoleon was not the man he
once was. And yet—and yet he nearly saved the
whole situation at Dresden! Three days’ fighting
there nearly counter-balanced all the disasters of the
previous eighteen months. Smolensk, Bautzen and
Dresden—three times he almost made up for all his
defeats. The conclusion is forced upon one that all
through the years of victory Napoleon was on the
verge of defeat, and all through the years of defeat
he was on the verge of victory. For twenty years
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
the fate of Europe hung balanced upon a razor
edge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon’s good luck is very evident; his bad
luck was an equally potent factor in his career. On
striking a balance and considering what enormous
success was his for a time, the resultant inference is
unavoidable. He was vastly superior to all the other
men of his time; his superiority was such that
individual differences between others fade into
insignificance when contrasted with the difference
between him and anyone else who may be selected
for comparison. He was superior not merely in
mental capacity, but in all other qualities necessary
for success in any sphere of business. His moral
courage was enormous; his finesse and rapidity of
thought were unequalled. He hardly knew what it
was to despair. His adaptability and his fertility of
resource were amazing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of this (or perhaps because of this) it is
very easy to detract from any of his achievements.
The Code Napoleon, his most enduring monument,
was not his own work, nor, of course, can much
credit be given to his assistants. Codification of
laws is in no way a new idea—it is almost
contemporary with laws themselves. Napoleon’s
German policy was much the same as that of
Louis XIV.; his Italian policy is reminiscent of
Charles VIII.’s or even earlier; the germ of his
Oriental policy can be found in that of Louis IX.;
his Spanish policy was similar to, but more unsuccessful
than that of his predecessors. Even the
Continental system was only the development of
previous schemes to their logical climax. In his
Court arrangements Napoleon brought no new idea
into play; most of his regulations were elaborated
from the ceremony which surrounded the Soleil
Monarque, while others were borrowed from the
etiquette of the courts of Vienna and Madrid. Any
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
approaching ceremony called for an anxious examination
of precedents; if Napoleon could find a parallel
far back stamped with the approval of a Valois or
an Orléans-Angoulême the matter was settled on
the same lines, no matter what inconveniences
resulted. Similarly in purely Imperial concerns he
was always harking back to Charlemagne or to the
Empire of Rome. It is exceedingly probable that
his annexation of Spain north of the Ebro in 1812,
which excited roars of derision all over Europe
because three-quarters of the district was aflame with
guerillas who shot on sight any Frenchman they
met, was directly inspired by Charlemagne’s action
a thousand years before. Charlemagne’s Spanish
campaign, even if it added the Spanish March to
his dominions, cost him his rearguard and all his
Paladins; Napoleon might well have taken warning.
The references to Imperial Rome, from the design
of his coinage and the plan of the Arc de Triomphe
to the “cohorts” of the National Guard and his
adoption of Eugène, are too numerous to mention.
We even find him going back farther still, and complaining
that he could not, like Alexander, announce
himself as of divine birth and the son of Jupiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In military matters an equally well (or ill) founded
charge of unoriginality can be brought against
Napoleon’s methods. To those of us who saw a
short time ago what changes four years of war
wrought in the weapons and tactics employed, it
seems amazing that at the end of twenty years of
life and death struggles the soldiers were still armed
with the smooth bore flintlock musket which had
already been in use for a century. Only two
important new weapons were evolved, and neither
of them attained any great popularity. They were
shrapnel shell and military rockets, and the latter, at
least, Napoleon never employed. The rifle never
attained any popularity with him, although to us it
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>
seems obvious that it was the weapon of the future.
Fulton offered Napoleon his steamboat invention,
and was treated as a wild dreamer—at the very time
when Napoleon was most preoccupied with the
problem of sending an army across the Channel.
As an irresponsible autocrat, Napoleon had boundless
opportunities of testing and employing any
new invention which might be suggested, but he
made no use of them. In this respect he compares
unfavourably with his far less gifted nephew.
Napoleon III.’s system of “sausages and champagne”
certainly finds a parallel in his uncle’s treatment
of his troops when not on active service.
When Napoleon’s armies returned victorious they
were received with fêtes and salutes innumerable; an
ignorant observer might well have believed them to
be demigods, to whom ceremonies and sacrifices
were peculiarly acceptable. The arrangement had
a double effect; it is certainly good for an army’s
esprit de corps for the men to be considered demigods;
and it is certainly useful for an autocrat whose
rule is based on his army to have his subjects believe
that that army is semi-divine. But for the little
personal comforts of his men Napoleon took small
notice. They were not relieved of the cumbersome
features of their uniforms; even if they were not
worried by petty details of pipeclay and brass polish
as were the English, they were still forced to wear
the horrible stock and tunic which Frederick the
Great had set in fashion. The French army slang
term “bleu” for recruit has its origin in the fact
that the recruits for the old army used to go black
and blue in the face owing to the unaccustomed
restriction of the Napoleonic stock. The French
helmets may have been imposing, but they were
terribly uncomfortable to wear. The gain in
efficiency resulting from a radical change in these
matters must have counter-balanced any possible loss
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>
in esprit de corps had Napoleon seen fit to bring this
change about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is with trembling and delicacy that one
approaches the realm in which Napoleon apparently
reigns supreme—that of tactics. It is a rash act to
say that the winner of sixty battles won them badly.
Yet one cannot help making a few cautious comments.
When Napoleon attained supreme power
the line and the column were almost equally in
favour in the French army. The most usual formation
in action was the line, backed at intervals by the
column. At Marengo this arrangement was largely
employed, and was successful. As time went on,
however, we find that the line disappeared, its place
was taken by additional skirmishers, and the columns
became heavier and heavier. The system was
altogether vicious; the column is both untrustworthy
and expensive. French columns might be
successful when pitted against any other columns,
but they failed against disciplined infantry formed
in line. Every battle and combat fought by the
English, from Alexandria and Maida to Vittoria,
proved this, but Napoleon and his officers never
learnt the lesson. The Emperor’s letters to his
generals in Spain give repeated examples of his
contempt for the English and Portuguese troops; it
was hardly a contempt that was justified. And
despite all these warnings, despite (so it is reported)
Soult’s and Foy’s pleadings, the first grand attack
at Waterloo was made by twenty thousand infantry
herded together twenty-four deep. This clumsy
mass was easily held up, outflanked and forced back
by six thousand English and Hanoverians under
Picton. It was not the first example which had
been forced upon Napoleon’s notice of the uselessness
of the column. At Wagram he had
sent Macdonald’s corps, some twenty thousand
strong, against the Austrian centre, massed in
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
a gigantic hollow square, which can be considered
as forming two columns each about thirty-five deep.
Macdonald reached his objective, but by the time
he arrived his men were so jostled together, ploughed
up by artillery, and generally demoralized that they
could effect nothing. One lesson such as this ought
to have convinced Napoleon, but it did not. He
continued to use columns—and he was beaten at
Waterloo. It is frequently urged in his defence
that the column was the “natural” formation in
the French army, that tradition had grown up
around it, so that it was unsafe to meddle with it,
that French troops fight better in column than in
line, and that his troops were of necessity so raw
that they could not be trusted in line. These arguments
seem completely nullified by the facts that the
line was actually employed early in Napoleon’s
career, that both before and after Waterloo French
troops fought well in line, and that at Waterloo, at
any rate, the French troops were all well-trained,
while Picton’s men were largely new recruits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The employment of cavalry in the Imperial
armies might similarly be condemned as extravagant
and inefficient. The system of Seidlitz under
Frederick the Great was forgotten. Napoleon had
uprooted the triumphal memorial erected at Rossbach,
and with it it seemed he had uprooted the
memory of the charges with which Seidlitz’ hard-welded
squadrons had routed the army of France
fifty years before. Murat’s famous charges were
not pressed home in the hard, utterly logical fashion
of Frederick’s cavalry. If the opposing infantry
stood firm at the approach of the cavalry, then the
latter parted and drifted away down each flank. If
(as must be admitted was much more usual) the
infantry broke at the sight of the horsemen tearing
down on them, then the pursuit was pushed home
remorselessly, but never do we find the perfect
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>
charge, in few ranks, packed close together and held
together like a steel chain, which must overturn
everything in its way. Under Napoleon the French
cavalry never charged home; at Waterloo we find
the great cavalry charges, which Ney directed against
the English squares, made at a trot, and the horsemen,
swerving from the steel-rimmed, fire-spouting
squares, wandering idly about on the flanks, while
a few of the more enterprising cut feebly at the
bayonets with their sabres. Wellington’s description
of them riding about as if they owned the place
argues powerfully against their ever having flung
themselves upon the bayonet points, as good cavalry
should do if sent against unbroken infantry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fact, both the French infantry and the French
cavalry relied upon the moral effect of their advance
rather than upon their capacity for doing damage
when they made their charges. It is perfectly true
that they were generally successful; Napoleon’s
dictum that the moral is to the physical as three to
one was borne out in a hundred battles from Arcola
to Dresden; but it was found wanting at Vimiero,
at Busaco, at Borodino, at Waterloo, everywhere in
fact, where the enemy was too stubborn or well-disciplined
to flinch from the waving sabres or the
grenadiers’ gigantic head-dresses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the wider field of strategy it cannot be denied
that Napoleon made use of original devices and
brought about revolutionary changes in the whole
system. They do not appear in the Italian campaign
of 1796 nor in the campaigns of Egypt and Marengo,
but in 1805 we find the cavalry screen completely
contrived and in efficient working order; in 1806 the
strategic advanced guard; and in 1807 the perfect
combination of the two. The curious part is that
Napoleon himself did not seem to realize the
importance of his own inventions; time and again
in 1812 and 1813 he did not employ them, with
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
invariably disastrous results. It seems a mistake on
Napoleon’s part not to have made use of the new
devices on these occasions, but it is unwise to condemn
him offhand, because it seems inconceivable
that he of all persons did not appreciate the magnitude
and efficiency of his own discoveries; there
must have been some reason not now apparent for
these actions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is very nearly impossible to discover any action
of Napoleon’s which was not faulty in some way, or
which could not be improved upon. But since he
met with unprecedented success the only conclusion
is that, although his mistakes were many, they were
far fewer than would have been the average man’s.
Furthermore, since his schemes were all so direct
and simple (a comparison between his plan and
Moreau’s for the crossing of the Rhine at Schaffhausen
in 1800 is very illuminating on this point),
no one can help feeling a sneaking suspicion, when
reading of Napoleon’s achievements, that he could
not have done the same—only just a little better.
Thiers’ long-drawn panegyric grows ineffably wearisome
simply on this account; the writer’s efforts to
minimize his hero’s errors are so obvious and so
ineffective that the reader is irritated by them, while
the continued superlatives seem to be given with
gross unfairness to a man whose blunders are so
difficult to conceal. It is far easier to write a
panegyric on a man who has done nothing whatever
than on a man whose whole life was spent in
productive activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of what has sometimes been termed Napoleon’s
cardinal error, the Continental System, I have not
ventured to speak. As originally conceived it was
undoubtedly a wise move. If France could exist
without English products, then obviously it was a
sound proceeding to deprive England of so rich a
market for her goods. The complications make the
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>
question much more difficult. Certainly the effort
to close the whole of Europe to British trade led
Napoleon into damaging annexations and disastrous
wars, while the fact that the countries involved,
Russia, for instance, preferred to fight rather than
to continue to enforce the system, seems to indicate
that it was impossible to enforce—that the country
(or at least its Government) could not continue to
exist without British trade. This is the simplest
complication of all. It is when we come to consider
Napoleon’s juggling with permits and licenses that
we become involved in the fog which surrounds all
tariff questions. The only certain points are that
Napoleon derived a large revenue from his licenses,
that the British Government was frequently severely
embarrassed for want of money (the difficulties
involved in collecting sufficient gold to pay subsidies
and the expenses of armies in the field led to
unfortunate delays), and that the discontent of the
Continent was great and general. It is a purely
arbitrary matter, dependent on the personal equation,
to come to any decision as to the balance of these
conclusions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking the career of Napoleon as a whole, it is
easy to see how frequently he was guilty of errors;
what should also be obvious is that it was almost
inevitable that he should fall into these errors. If
the Austrian marriage was a mistake, then it was a
mistake Napoleon could not help making; undoubtedly
he did the best he could for himself in the
prevailing circumstances. If the advance into Russia
was a mistake, it is impossible to indicate what
alternative could have been chosen, for Napoleon,
at war with Russia, could not safely remain at war
without gaining a decision; he could hardly maintain
an army on the Russian frontier awaiting Alexander’s
pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If it was a mistake to advance into Belgium in
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>
June, 1815, it would have been a far worse one not
to have advanced. The greatest mistake of those
into which he was <span class='it'>not</span> driven by circumstances was
his theft of the throne of Spain—and it was that
which ruined him.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>HEN Napoleon abdicated after Waterloo,
for the second time, the Allies had
achieved the object for which ostensibly
they had made war. The Emperor had fallen, and
the war they had waged had, they declared, been
directed entirely against him. The immediate and
burning question now arose as to what was to be
done with the man against whom a million other
men were on the march. Blücher wanted to catch
him and shoot him; Wellington, with his usual
cautious good sense, did not want to be burdened
with the responsibility of an action which might
be unnecessary and would certainly be unpopular.
Napoleon himself, disowned by the government
and by the army, wanted to retire to America, but
his enemies were unwilling to set him free. The
English fleet blockaded the coast, and Napoleon was
compelled to surrender to it, lest worse should befall
from the Prussians, or the Republicans, or the
White Terror, or from personal enemies. He tried
to make the best of his necessity by claiming the
hospitality of England, but England kept him a
close prisoner until her Allies had been consulted.
They offered to hand him over to Louis XVIII. for
trial as a rebel, but even Louis had the sense to
decline the offer. He could shoot Ney and la
Bédoyère, but he could not shoot Napoleon. For
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
Louis to shut him up in a fortress would be as
dangerous as it would be for a private individual to
keep a tiger in his cellar. In the same way no
Continental state would willingly see any other
appointed his guardian. That would mean giving
the guardian country a most potent instrument of
menace. England remained the sole possible gaoler,
and England accepted the responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next arose the question as to the locality of
the prison, and the answer to that question was
already prepared—St. Helena. To keep Napoleon
in England was obviously impossible, for England
was nearer France even than was Elba, while,
incredible though it might seem, the oligarchy
which ruled England were afraid lest Napoleon
should corrupt the mass of the people to Republicanism.
That there was some foundation for this
fear is shown by the intense interest in Napoleon
which the people displayed while he was in Plymouth
harbour. Similar arguments were effective against
Malta or any other Mediterranean island. But
St. Helena had none of these disadvantages. It
was thousands of miles away; it was small, and could
be filled with troops; there were only two possible
places for landing, and these could be well guarded;
the few reports on the island which were to be had
seemed to indicate that fair comfort was obtainable
there, and, above all, it was not at all a place where
ships or individuals could easily find an excuse for
calling or remaining. Even before the descent from
Elba St. Helena had been suggested as a more
suitable place for Napoleon’s prison, and now, with
little discussion, he was sent off there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is impossible to argue about the legality or
otherwise of this decision. Morally, the Powers
were as justified in imprisoning Napoleon as is a
government in locking up a homicidal maniac. A
maniac may hurt people; Napoleon might hurt the
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
Powers. Napoleon might hurt them for reasons
which to him might appear perfectly defensible; but
a homicidal maniac can usually boast the same purity
of motive. The maniac may be right and everyone
else wrong; Napoleon may have been right and the
Powers wrong; but the Powers were none the less
justified in seeing that he could do no more harm. It
has been argued that by invading France and removing
her ruler Europe was committing a moral crime;
that it is intolerable for one country to interfere in
another country’s system of government. This argument
fails because its scope is inelastic. In the same
way it is said that “an Englishman’s house is his
castle,” and that, for instance, a man’s conduct
towards, or training of, his children is his own
personal business. But if that man tries to cut his
children’s throats, or worse, encourages his children
to cut his neighbours’ throats, then the State steps
in and prevents him from doing so. That is exactly
what the Powers did with Napoleon. Where they
went wrong was in not seeing that their decision was
carried into effect with humanity and dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The initial arrangements for Napoleon’s exile
seemed to portend that he would end his days in
luxury. Lord Liverpool had said that on the island
there was a most comfortable house exactly suited
for Napoleon and his suite; Lord Bathurst had
given official orders that he was to be allowed all
possible indulgence so long as his detention was
not imperilled. But Napoleon was not given the
comfortable house, while Bathurst’s confidential
orders to Sir Hudson Lowe displayed unbelievable
rigour. Already Napoleon had experienced some of
the results of the workings of the official mind; the
naval officers with whom he had come in contact
had been strictly ordered not to pay him any of the
compliments usually accorded to royalty. They
remained covered in his presence, and they addressed
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
him as “General Bonaparte.” Cockburn, the
Admiral in command, acted strictly to the letter
of the orders which commanded him to treat
“General Bonaparte” in the same manner as he
would a general officer not in employ. If Napoleon
seemed inclined to act with more dignity than this
rather humble station would warrant, then Cockburn
was distant and reserved; but if Napoleon ever showed
signs of “conducting himself with modesty,” as
Cockburn himself writes, then the Admiral was
graciously pleased to unbend a little to his helpless
prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole question of the title was intricate and
irritating. The English Government declared that
they had never recognized Napoleon as Emperor even
at the height of his power, and they certainly were
not going to do so now that he was a discredited
outcast. They were hardly correct in fact or in
theory, for they had sent him an Ambassador when
he was First Consul; they had sent plenipotentiaries
to Châtillon who had signed documents in which he
was called Emperor; they had sent a representative
to him at Elba when he was Emperor there, and,
equally important, they had ratified the Convention
of Cintra, among the documents of which he was
distinctly called His Imperial Majesty. Moreover,
by refusing him this mode of address, they were
insulting the French people, who had elected him,
the Courts of Europe, who had recognized him, and
the Pope, who had crowned and anointed him. It
was the English Government which lost its dignity
in this ridiculous affair, not Napoleon. But the
worst result of this decision was not the loss of
dignity, nor the injury to French pride. It was that
it gave Napoleon an opportunity to hit back. It
gave him a definite cause of complaint, apart from
that of his arbitrary incarceration, which was
generally held to be justified. It was the first
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
opportunity of many, of all of which Napoleon
eagerly took advantage, so that the Napoleonic
Legend had a firm base for future development.
By complaining at any and every opportunity
Napoleon was able to surround his own memory
with an aura of frightful privations, so that it was
easy for his subtle nephew later to picture him as
Prometheus, the benefactor of mankind, bound to
his rock in mid-ocean with the vultures of the allied
commissioners gnawing at his liver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A further blunder on the part of the English
Government afforded Napoleon his next cause of
complaint. Sir Hudson Lowe was a good, if
unimaginative soldier who had fought all his life
against the French. Furthermore, he had commanded
a force of Corsican Rangers, recruited from
the island that was Napoleon’s birthplace. He had
held Capri for two years in the face of Masséna
and Joseph Bonaparte, and was only turned out
by a daring expedition sent by Murat. His very
name was hateful to Napoleon, and yet he was
appointed his guardian. But this was not all. A
huge responsibility devolved upon Sir Hudson Lowe.
A moment’s carelessness on his part might allow
Napoleon to escape, and if Napoleon escaped there
might ensue another Waterloo campaign with a very
different result. The responsibility was too great
altogether for Lowe. Because of it he carried out
the orders sent him with a strictness which knew no
bounds. He pestered the wretched prisoner, who
already had good reason to dislike him, until he
nearly drove him frantic. Lowe himself was
desperate, and many people who saw him during that
period commented on his worried demeanour and
his inability to support his responsibilities. It is easy
then to imagine the violent friction which prevailed
between him and his captive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On a casual inspection, the restrictions imposed
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
upon Napoleon do not seem particularly severe. He
was to keep within certain limits; he was to be
accompanied by an English officer if he went beyond
them; his correspondence was to pass through
Lowe’s hands, and he was to assure the English of
his presence every day. But these restrictions galled
Napoleon inexpressibly. Along the boundaries of
his free area was posted a line of sentries, and he
could not turn his eyes in any direction without
perceiving the hated redcoats. The continued
presence of an officer if he rode elsewhere was
not unnaturally irksome—so irksome, in fact, that
Napoleon, who had previously passed half his days
on horseback, gave up riding—while the mortification
of having his letters pried into and the utter, hateful
humiliation of having to exhibit himself on command
to an Englishman must have been maddening to a
man who not so many months before had ruled half
Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon found himself shut up in a restricted
area and with limited accommodation; he had no old
friends with him, because he had never had any
friends; of the five officers who had accompanied
him only two were men of any distinction and of
any length of service. Not one of them was
particularly talented, and they were one and all
fiercely jealous of each other. Add to these
conditions a tropical climate and the utter despair
into which they were all plunged, and it is easy to
realize that furious quarrels and bitter heart-burnings
must have been their lot. It is the most
difficult matter in the world to find the exact truth
about what went on in Longwood. Everyone concerned
wrote voluminously, and everyone concerned
wrote accounts which differed from everyone else’s.
There is an atmosphere of untruth surrounding
everything which has been written by the actors in
this last tragedy. Napoleon himself set his friends
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>
the example, for his dictated memoirs and the
information which he gave Las Cases to help him in
his writings are full of lies, some cunning, some
clumsy, but all of them devised for obvious
purposes. He tried to throw the blame of the
Spanish insurrection on Murat, the blame of the
execution of d’Enghien on Talleyrand, the blame of
Waterloo on Grouchy. It is difficult to discover
whether he was merely trying to excuse himself in
the eyes of the world, or to rehabilitate Bonapartism
so that his son might eventually mount the Imperial
throne. And his companions’ memoirs lie so
blatantly and so obviously that one cannot decide
which was his aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon himself had deteriorated vastly. As
might be expected, his complete cessation of bodily
activity led to an increase in his corpulence until he
became gross and unwieldy. His mental power had
decayed, although he was still able to dictate for
hours on end. Even under the burdensome conditions
imposed upon him he never seems to have
abandoned the rigid reserve which he had maintained
all his life. The few scenes which the memoirists
describe which have a ring of truth about them seem
to show him still acting a part, still posing as the
inestimably superior being whom his followers
believed him to be. Sometimes we have a brief
glimpse of him stripped of his heroics, as witness
the occasion when he said bitterly that his son must
necessarily have forgotten him; but most of the time
he seems to have adhered to his old methods, and
posed as the misunderstood benefactor of humanity,
ignoring Marie Louise’s defection, ignoring the distrust
with which the Council of State had regarded
him during the last months of his reign; in fact
proclaiming himself the man who martyred himself
for the French nation, with such iteration that he
was at last believed. His declamations have coloured
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>
nearly everything written since, so that it is quite
usual to find it stated, either actually or inferentially,
that his fall was due solely to the jealousy of
the other rulers of Europe, and not due in any
degree to the slowly developed dislike of his own
subjects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all this time he was making Sir Hudson
Lowe’s life a burden to him as well. Some of
Napoleon’s complaints were just, some merely
frivolous, but every one of them goaded Lowe into
further painful activity. This activity reacted in
another direction, so that Lowe issued edicts of
increased stringency, and, half mad with responsibility,
treated Napoleon with an exaggeration of
precaution and imposed upon him restraints of a
pettiness and a casuistry almost unbelievable. It can
hardly be doubted that Napoleon actually sought
opportunities for egging Lowe on to further ill-treatment;
he certainly treated him with a most
amazing contumely, and it is very probable that
the numerous rumours of attempts at rescue, by
submarine boat, by an armed force from Brazil, or
by any other fantastic means, had their origin in
Napoleon himself, so that Lowe was inspired to
further obnoxious measures. Napoleon made the
most of his opportunity. He raised a clamour which
reached Europe (as he had intended), so that interest
in his fate and sympathy for the poor ill-treated
captive gradually worked up to fever heat. He sold
his plate to buy himself necessaries (at a time when
he had ample money at his command) and of course
France heard about it, and was wrung with pity for
the wretched man forced by his captor’s rapacity to
dine off earthenware. The fact that Napoleon nevertheless
retained sufficient silver to supply his table
was not so readily divulged. He made a continual
complaint about his health; undoubtedly he was not
well, and equally undoubtedly he was already suffering
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
from the disease which killed him; but his
complaints were neither consistent nor, as far as can
be ascertained, entirely true. He hinted that the
Powers were endeavouring to shorten his life; he
even said that he went in fear of assassins. All
this news reached Europe by devious routes, and
sympathy grew and grew until, after the lapse of
years, it waxed into the hysteria evinced at his
second funeral and the more effective hysteria which
set Napoleon III. on the throne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite all the undignified squabbles in which he
was engaged, one can nevertheless hardly restrain a
feeling of admiration for Napoleon amid the trials
which he was enduring. He was hitting back as
hard as circumstances would allow him, and he was
hitting back with effect. He had driven Lowe
frantic, and he had secured his object of reviving
European interest in him. Furthermore, he flatly
refused to submit to the humiliating commands
which Lowe attempted to enforce. Lowe might
speak of “General Bonaparte” or “Napoleon
Bonaparte” (in the same way as he might speak of
John Robinson, says Lord Rosebery) but in his own
home Napoleon was always His Imperial Majesty
the Emperor, to whom everyone uncovered, and in
whose presence everyone remained standing. Lowe’s
order that he must show himself to an English officer
every day was completely ignored, and we hear of
officers climbing trees and peering through keyholes
in vain attempts to make sure of his presence. For
days together Napoleon might have been out of the
island for all Lowe knew to the contrary. The
commissioners sent by France and Austria and
Russia did not set eyes on him from the time of
their arrival until after his death. Napoleon had
sworn that he would shoot with his own hand the
first man who intruded on his privacy, and he was
believed; the attempt was never made, and Napoleon
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>
continued to reign in Longwood, in an <span class='it'>imperium in
imperio</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole period seems indescribably sordid and
wretched. Napoleon’s companions were intriguing
jealously for his favour, scheming for the privilege
of eating at his table, and even endeavouring to be
sure that he would leave them his money in his will.
Tropical weather, harassing conditions, prolonged
strain, and the overwhelming gloom of recent frightful
disasters, all tended towards overstrained nerves
and continual quarrels. Napoleon wrangling with
Lowe over his dinner-service; Montholon in tears
because Napoleon chooses to dine with Las Cases;
an Emperor quarrelling with a general as to whether
or not his liver is enlarged; this is not tragedy, it is
only squalor with a hideously tragic taint. It is
Lear viewed through reversed opera-glasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The end came at last in 1821. The disease of
which his father had died held Napoleon as well
in its grip. He was an intractable patient, and
diagnosis was not easy, but it certainly seems that
the medical treatment he received was unspeakably
bad. He was dosed with tartar emetic, of all drugs,
at a time when his stomach was deranged with
cancer. At times he suffered frightful agony. He
bore it somehow; argued with his doctors, chaffed
his friends, until at last he sank into unconsciousness,
and he died while a great storm howled round the
island. The lies and contradictions of the memoirists
persist even here, for no one knows accurately what
were his last words, or when they were uttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The post-mortem report is sufficient to convince
any reader that none of the doctors concerned knew
their business;<a id='rA'/><a href='#fA' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[A]</span></sup></a> the man who had once ruled Europe
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
was now thrust into a coffin too small to allow him
to wear his complete uniform, so that his hat rested
on his stomach; and he was buried in one of his old
favourite spots in the island. Once more there arose
the old vexed question of title, for the French wished
to inscribe “Napoleon” on the coffin; Lowe insisted
on “Bonaparte” being added; in the end it was a
nameless coffin which was lowered into the grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, I believe, a fact never previously published
that the first post-mortem certificate drawn up by the
doctors responsible was rejected by Sir Hudson Lowe.
It contained the words “the liver was perhaps a little
larger than natural,” and this remark naturally did not
commend itself to Lowe, in consequence of the fierce
quarrels he had had with Napoleon on this very subject.
The post-mortem certificate in the English Record Office
does not contain these words, but the Rev. Canon E. Brook
Jackson, Rector of Streatham, has in his possession the
earlier certificate, signed by the doctors concerned, with
the footnote “N.B.—The words obliterated were suppressed
by order of Sir Hudson Lowe. Signed, Thomas
Short, P.M.O.” The words referred to are clearly
legible and are those given above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon failed during his lifetime, but he was
triumphant after death. His gallant fight at St.
Helena against overwhelming odds was remembered
with pride by every Frenchman. Men hearing
garbled versions of his sufferings felt a pricking of
their consciences that they had abandoned him in
1814 and 1815. The helpless policy of Louis XVIII.
and Charles X., and the humdrum policy of Louis
Philippe set all minds thinking of the glorious days,
not so very long ago, when France had been Queen of
the Continent. Louis Napoleon skilfully employed
the revulsion of feeling to his own advantage, and the
glory of Austerlitz and Jena was sufficient to hide
the absurdities of Boulogne and Strasbourg. But it
was the six years’ struggle of St. Helena which made
so refulgent that glory of Austerlitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What the British Government could have done
to prevent the formation of a St. Helena legend
cannot easily be decided. They were in terror lest
he should escape again, and severe ordinances were
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
necessary to prevent this. Had they treated him
luxuriously, public opinion in England would have
been roused to a dangerous pitch. They had originally
tried to get out of the difficulty by handing
him over to Louis XVIII. for execution, but
Louis XVIII. had no real case against him. A
state trial would have given Napoleon unbounded
opportunities for the rhetoric in which he delighted,
and which had so often rallied France to his side.
Napoleon might well have pleaded, with perfect
truth, that in the descent from Elba he was no
rebel, but the Emperor of Elba making war upon
the King of France; but so tame a plea would hardly
have been employed. Napoleon would have proclaimed
himself the purest altruist come to see that
the French people obtained their rights, or to save
France from the machinations of tyrants. Louis
was wise in refusing the offer. The custody of
Napoleon was thus thrust upon the British Government.
If remarkably far-sighted, they might have
lapped him in every luxury; have treated him
subserviently as if he was Emperor in fact as well
as in name; they might have encouraged him to
debauchery as wild as Tiberius’ at Capri; and then
by subtle propaganda they might have exhibited him
to a scornful world as a man who cared nothing for
his lost greatness, or for the dependence of his
position. Such a scheme appealed favourably to
the imagination, but there was an insuperable
obstacle—Napoleon. Napoleon had a definite plan
of campaign. He was going to complain about
everything and everybody with whom he came in
contact. He was going to clamour unceasingly
against the brutality and arbitrariness of his gaolers.
Without regard for truth he was going to proclaim
continually that he was being ill-treated and
martyred, and he would have done it whatever had
been his treatment, and, being Napoleon, he would
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
have done it well. The error of the British Government
lay in their affording him so many opportunities,
not in their affording him any at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after he was dead there followed the events
which he had foreseen and over whose engendering
he had laboured so diligently. Little by little the
evil features of the Imperial régime were forgotten;
the glory of his victories blazed more brightly in
comparison with the exhaustion of France under the
Bourbons and the pettifogging Algerian razzias of
Louis Philippe. The literature of St. Helena, both
the spurious and the inspired, induced men to believe
that Napoleon was the exact opposite of what he
really was. It gave him credit for the achievements
of Carnot; it shifted the disgrace of failure on to the
shoulders of helpless scapegoats. It proved to the
satisfaction of the uninquiring that Napoleon stood
for democracy, for the principle of nationality, and
even for peace. It raised to the Imperial throne the
man who said “the Empire means peace.” The
whole legend which developed was a flagrant denial
of patent facts, but it was a denial sufficiently
reiterated to be believed. The belief is not yet dead.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>T is much more than a hundred years since Napoleon
lived; since his time we have witnessed cataclysms
more vast than were the Napoleonic wars; the
Europe of that period seems to us as unfamiliar and
as profitless a study as Siam or primitive Australia.
Perhaps this is so. Perhaps the lessons to be drawn from
the Napoleonic era are now exhausted. Perhaps the
epoch ushered in by Marengo is slight and unimportant
compared to that which follows the Marne. Perhaps
Englishmen will forget the men who stood firm in the
squares at Waterloo, and will only remember those who
stood firm at Ypres and the Second Marne. Perhaps the
Congress of Vienna will lapse into insignificance when
compared with the Congress of Versailles. But this is
inconceivable. Previously, perhaps, too much importance
has been attached to the Napoleonic era, but that is
because it had no parallel; it was unique. Similarly the
period pivoting about the Great War of 1914-18 might be
said to be unique, but it is not so. The two epochs are
very closely related, very closely indeed. Much may be
gained from the study of either, but this is nothing to be
compared with the gain resulting from the study and
comparison of the two together. In this way the
Napoleonic era becomes more significant even than it was
before the great war, and this without considering how
much of the great war was directly due to arrangements
made as a consequence of Napoleon’s career.
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>But apart from all such considerations, the study of
the period is one from which a great deal of purely personal
pleasure can be derived. Even nowadays one cannot help
a thrill of excitement when reading of the advance of the
British infantry at Albuera; one cannot help feeling a
surge of emotion on reading how Alvarez at the siege
of Gerona moaned “No surrender! No surrender!”
although he was dying of fever and half the populace lay
dead in the streets, while the other half still fought on
against all the might of Reille and St. Cyr. Even the
best novel compares unfavourably with Ségur’s account
of the Russian campaign; and although there is no French
biographer quite as good as Boswell, yet there are scores
of memoirs and biographies of the period which rank very
nearly as high, and which are pleasant to read at all
times. Marbot may be untruthful, but he is delightful
reading; Madame Junot gives a picture of her times and
of the people whom she met which is honestly worthy of
comparison with Dickens and Thackeray; while to track
down in their memoirs Fouché’s and Talleyrand’s carefully
concealed mistakes is as interesting a pastime as
ever was the attempt to guess the dénouement in a modern
detective novel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The literature of the time is full of happy anecdotes,
some of which have attained the supreme honour of being
taken out bodily, furnished with modern trimmings,
and published in twentieth century magazines, without
acknowledgment, as modern humour. But many have
escaped this fate, partly because they are untranslatable,
and partly because they bear the definite imprint of the
period. Thus there is the story of the fat and pursy King
of Würtemberg, who once kept waiting a committee of the
Congress of Vienna. At last he arrived, and as his portly
majesty came bustling through the door, Talleyrand
remarked, “Here comes the King of Würtemberg, <span class='it'>ventre
à terre</span>.” In a grimmer vein is the story of the reception
held on the night after Ney was shot. The company
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>
were mournfully discussing the tragedy, when a certain
M. Lemaréchal was announced. As this gentleman had
a son of mature years, the announcement was worded
“M. Lemaréchal ainé”—which the panic-stricken
assembly heard as “M. le Maréchal Ney.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the heroes of that time have had the bad
luck to be misrepresented not only in literature but even
in portraits and in sculpture. Napoleon had at one time
the plan of placing statues of all his generals in the
Louvre, but he abdicated before the work was anywhere
near completion, and left its continuation to his successors.
Louis and Charles did nothing towards it, and the
parsimonious Louis Philippe, when he came to the throne,
decided as a measure of economy only to represent the
most famous. But some of the statues of junior officers
were already finished. Louis Philippe saw his chance of
still greater economy. For Lasalle’s head was substituted
Lannes’; for Colbert’s, Mortier’s; while the entire statue
of St. Hilaire was simply labelled Masséna and set up
without further alteration. These statues are still in the
Louvre; no subsequent correction has ever been made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the anecdotes are responsible for only a very
small part of the interest of Napoleonic literature. Many
of the subsequent histories are very nearly models of
everything a book ought to be. Napier’s “Peninsular
War,” despite its bias and its frequent inaccuracies, has
already become a classic; Sir Charles Oman’s work on the
same subject is much more striking and makes a far
greater appeal. His descriptions of the siege of Gerona
and of the cavalry pursuit at Tudela are more moving in
their cold eloquence than ever was Napier at his fieriest.
One English author whose books have attracted far less
attention than they should have done is Mr. F. Loraine
Petre; his accurate and impartial histories of the
successive Napoleonic campaigns are dramatic enough to
hold the interest of the ordinary reader as well as that of
the military student. In matters other than military, the
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
writer whose reputation overtops all others is M. Frédéric
Masson. His celebrity is such that it would be almost
impertinence to cavil at his writings. For painstaking
and careful accumulation of evidence he stands far and
away above all his contemporaries. He examines and
brings to notice every single detail. A catalogue of an
Empress’s chemises interests him as deeply as a list of a
Council of State. The trouble is that his catalogue of
chemises is merely a catalogue of chemises—as interesting
as a laundress’s bill. M. Masson’s books are exceedingly
important and invaluable to the student: but that they
are important and invaluable is all one can say about
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ultimate source of much information is, of course,
the endless collection of volumes of Napoleon’s correspondence.
Even merely to glance at one of these is a
lesson in industry far more thorough than anything
achieved by the worthy Dr. Samuel Smiles and his like.
Examination of a single day’s correspondence is sufficient
to show the complexity of Napoleon’s interests, the extent
of his knowledge of each subject, and the nature of the
driving power which built up the First Empire. Close
study of the Correspondence is necessary to enable one
to follow the twists and turns of Napoleon’s policy; the
main difficulty is that the bundle of hay is so large that
the finding of needles in it is a painfully tedious business.
However, the casual reader will find that this spadework
has been done for him by a large number of painstaking
writers. Even during the present century several English
authors have published books upon particular events and
persons of the Napoleonic era. Mr. Hilliard Atteridge is
an example of those who have done the best work in this
direction. But the greater number of these books seem
to be struck with the same blight—they are ineffably
tedious. Generally they are most correct as to facts;
their impartiality is admirable; the knowledge displayed
is wide; but they are most terribly boring to read. They
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>
are useful to familiarize the reader with the various
persons described so that their place in the whole period
is better understood, for the Napoleonic era is a tangled
skein of threads, each of them a different personality,
wound round and completely dependent upon the central
core, which is Napoleon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of biographies and general histories it is impossible to
speak definitely. Napoleon can boast hundreds more
lives than any cat in fact or fancy. The percentage of
lies contained in books on Napoleon varies between ten
and ninety—and what is more aggravating is that the
picturesque and readable lives are usually those which
contain the most inexactitudes. It is perfectly safe to say
that no Life of Napoleon has ever been written which
combines complete accuracy with genuine readableness.
This is of small account, however, for one has only to
read enough of the readable and inexact lives to form a
fairly correct opinion on most matters of importance at
the same time as one enjoys both the reading and the
forming of the opinion. The contemporary memoirs are
very useful, and are mainly interesting. Bourrienne’s
biography is rather overrated usually, for he is unreliable
in personal matters, and a great deal of his book is
undeniably heavy. One of his most illuminating pictures
shows Napoleon driving with him over the countryside,
and ignoring the beauty of the scenery in favour of the
military features of the landscape. This anecdote receives
an additional interest when it is recalled that an exactly
similar story is told of von Schlieffen, the German Chief
of Staff of the ’nineties, who planned the advance
through Belgium which had such vast consequences in
1914. One certainly cannot help thinking that if Napoleon
had been at the head of the German army at that
date he, too, would have advanced through Belgium,
and this tiny parallel offers curious corroboration. Such
a move would have been in complete accordance
with Napoleon’s character—compare Bernadotte’s march
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>
through Anspach in 1805. The way in which Napoleon
took enormous risks, such as this, and his method of
securing the friendship of other Powers by storming and
bluster instead of by finesse, is the most curious trait of
his whole curious character. Bourrienne offers several
examples; so do Talleyrand, Fouché, Pasquier and Molé.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some decades after Napoleon’s death an immense
amount of spurious or heavily revised reminiscent literature
appeared. Constant (the valet), Josephine, and
various others, are credited with volumes of ingeniously
written memoirs. They are well worth reading, but they
contain little worth remembering. In many matters they
are demonstrably incorrect, and they are generally
prejudiced and misleading. For personal and intimate
details one of the best contemporary writers is de Bausset,
who certainly wrote the book which bears his name, and
who equally certainly was in a position to perceive what
he described, for he was a palace official for many years
under the Empire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In military matters the Marshals’ memoirs are
peculiarly enlightening, not so much in matters of detail
(in fact they are frequently incorrect there) but in
exhibiting the characters of the writers themselves.
Davout’s book is just what one would expect of him, cold
and unrelenting and yet sound and brilliant. Suchet’s is
cynical and clever and subtle, and, if necessary, untrue.
St. Cyr’s displays his jealousy, suspicion and general
unpleasantness along with undoubted proof of talent.
Macdonald’s is bluff and honest. There is a whole host of
smaller fry, from Marbot downwards, who wrote fascinating
little books about the Army and their own personal
experiences. Some of them, such as the Reminiscences
of Colonel de Gonneville, have appeared in English.
They are all obtainable in French. The last authority, of
course, on military matters is the Correspondence.
There are only one or two doubtful letters in the whole
collection, and these are either printed with reserve or
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>
bear the proofs of their spuriousness on the face of
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no matter how much is written, or published, or
read, no two men will ever form quite the same estimate
of Napoleon. It is as easy to argue that he only rose
through sheer good luck as it is to argue that he only
fell through sheer bad luck. He can be compared to
Iscariot or to St. Paul, to Alexander or to Wilhelm II.
At times he seems a body without a soul; at others, a soul
without a body. All this seems to indicate that he was a
man of contradictions, but on the other hand he was,
admittedly, thoroughly consistent in all his actions. The
most one can hope for is to form one’s own conclusions
about him; one cannot hope to form other people’s.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
